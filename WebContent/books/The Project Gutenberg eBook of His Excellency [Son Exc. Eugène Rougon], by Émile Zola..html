<h4><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h4>


<p>We live at such high speed nowadays, and the Second French
Empire is already so far behind us, that I am inclined to
place <i>Son Excellence Eugène Rougon</i> in the category of historical
novels. In some degree it certainly belongs to another
class of fiction, the political novel, which in Great Britain
sprouted, blossomed, and faded away contemporaneously with
the career of Benjamin Disraeli. But, unlike Disraeli's work,
it does not deal with theories or possibilities. Whatever
political matter it may contain is a record of incidents which
really occurred, of intrigues which were matured, of opinions
which were more or less publicly expressed while the third
Napoleon was ruling France. In my opinion, with all due
allowance for its somewhat limited range of subject, <i>Son
Excellence Eugène Rougon</i> is the one existing French novel
which gives the reader a fair general idea of what occurred in
political spheres at an important period of the Empire. It is
a book for foreigners and particularly Englishmen to read
with profit, for there are yet many among them who cherish
the delusion that Napoleon III. was not only a good and true
friend of England, but also a wise and beneficent ruler of
France; and this, although his reign began with bloodshed
and trickery, was prolonged by means of innumerable subterfuges,
and ended in woe, horror, and disgrace.</p>

<p>The present translation of M. Zola's book was not made
by me, but I have revised it somewhat severely with the
object of ensuring greater accuracy in all the more important
passages, and of improving the work generally. And, subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
to those limitations which deference for the opinion of the
majority of English-speaking readers has imposed on the translator
and myself, I consider that this rendering fully conveys
the purport of the original. During the work of revision I
was struck by the great care shown by M. Zola in the handling
of his subject. There is, of course, some fiction in the
book; but, again and again, page after page, I have found a
simple record of fact, just deftly adapted to suit the requirements
of the narrative. The history of the Second Empire is
probably as familiar to me as it is to M. Zola himself—for,
like him, I grew to manhood in its midst, with better opportunities,
too, than he had of observing certain of its distinguishing
features—and thus I have been able to identify
innumerable incidents and allusions, and trace to their very
source some of the most curious passages in the book. And
it is for this reason, and by virtue of my own knowledge and
experience, that I claim for <i>His Excellency</i> the merit of
reflecting things as they really were in the earlier years of the
Imperial <i>régime</i>.</p>

<p>Against one surmise the reader must be cautioned.
Napoleon III. and the Empress Eugénie figure in the following
pages without disguise; and wherever the name of the
Count de Marsy appears, that of the infamous Duke de
Morny—whom Sir Robert Peel, in one of his most slashing
speeches, did not scruple to call the greatest jobber in
Europe—may be read without a moment's hesitation. But
his Excellency Eugène Rougon is not, as many critics and
others have supposed, a mere portrait or caricature of his
Excellency Eugène Rouher, the famous Vice-Emperor of
history. Symbolism is to be found in every one of M. Zola's
novels, and Rougon, in his main lines, is but the symbol of a
principle, or, to be accurate, the symbol of a certain form of
the principle of authority. His face is Rouher's, like his
build and his favourite gesture; but with Rouher's words,
actions, opinions, and experiences are blended those of half-a-dozen
other personages. The forgotten ones! the men whose
names were once a terror, but who are as little remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
as little known, in France to-day, as the satraps of the
vanished Eastern realms, as the eunuchs who ruled the civilised
world on behalf of effete Emperors when Byzantium,
amidst all her splendour, was, like Paris, tottering to ruin.
Baroche, Billault, Delangle, Fialin <i>alias</i> Persigny, Espinasse—there
is something of each of these, as well as something of
Rouher, in the career of Eugène Rougon as narrated by
M. Zola. Words which one or another of these men wrote
or uttered, things which one or another of them actually did,
are fathered upon Rougon. He embodies them all: he is the
incarnation of that craving, that lust for power which impelled
so many men of ability to throw all principle to the
winds and become the instruments of an abominable system
of government. And his transformation at the close of the
story is in strict accordance with historical facts. He salutes
the rise of the so-called 'Liberal' Empire in the very words
of Billault—the most tyrannical of all the third Napoleon's
'band.'</p>

<p>Rougon has a band of his own—they all had bands in
those days, like the Emperor himself; and since that time we
have in a similar way seen Gambetta and his <i>queue</i> and
Boulanger and his <i>clique</i>. And, curiously enough, as in
Rougon's case, those historic coteries were in each instance
the prime factors in their leader's overthrow. Thus we have
only to turn to the recorded incidents of history to realise the
full truth of M. Zola's account of the Rougon gang. It is a
masterly account, instinct with accuracy, as real as life itself.</p>

<p>And Rougon, on whatever patchwork basis he may have
been built, is a living figure, one of a nature so direct, so free
from intricacy, that few ignorant of the truth would imagine
him to be a patchwork creation at all. Surely, to have so
fully assimilated in one personage the characteristics of half-a-dozen
known men in such wise that, without any clashing
of individual proclivities, the whole six are truthfully embodied
in one, is a signal proof of that form of genius which
lies in the infinite capacity for taking pains.</p>

<p>If we pass from Rougon to Marsy we find another embodiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
of that principle of authority which both help to
represent. Rougon, as M. Zola says, is the shaggy fist which
deals the knock-down blow, while Marsy is the gloved hand
which stabs or throttles. Years ago, when I was unacquainted
with this comparison, and was contrasting the rising genius
of Emile Zola with that of his great and splendid rival,
Alphonse Daudet, I likened M. Zola to the fist and M. Daudet
to the rapier. A French critic had previously called the
former a cactus and the latter an Arab steed. The cactus
comparison, as applied to M. Zola, was a very happy one;
for I defy anybody, even the smuggest of hypocrites, to read
M. Zola's works without some prickings of conscience. And
verily I believe that most of the opposition to the author of
the Rougon-Macquart series arises from that very cause.</p>

<p>But I must return to Marsy, though he need not detain
me long, for he only flits across the following pages with his
regal air and sardonic smile. For a fuller and, in some
degree, a more favourable portrait, one must turn to the
pages of Daudet, who of course could not write ill of the man
to whom he owed his start in life. In the present work,
slight as is the sketch, Marsy, or Morny, the name signifies
little, is shown as he really was—venal, immoral, witty, and
exquisitely polite. Then there is Delestang, who, physically,
represents M. Magne; while in like way Beulin-d'Orchère,
the judge whose sister marries Rougon, is copied from
Delangle, whose bulldog face is alluded to by most of the
<i>anecdotiers</i> of the Empire. La Rouquette is, by name at
all events, a connection of Forcade de la Roquette—a step-brother
of Marshal St. Arnaud—who rose to influence and
power in the latter days of the Empire; and M. de Plouguern,
the profligate old senator, reminds me in some respects of
that cynical and eccentric Anglomaniac, the Marquis de
Boissy. The various members of Rougon's band are sketched
from less-known people. Kahn I cannot quite identify, but
I suspect him to be the deputy who was mixed up in the
scandal of the Graissesac railway line, to which M. Zola
refers as the line from Niort to Angers. However, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
no member of the band that I like better than Béjuin, the
silent deputy, who never asks a favour, and yet has favours
continually showered upon him. I have known a man of
that character connected with English public life.</p>

<p>To return to those of M. Zola's masculine characters who
may be identified with real personages, none is more genially,
more truthfully, portrayed than Chevalier Rusconi, the Italian
or, more correctly, Sardinian, Minister in Paris. Here we
have that most amiable of men, Chevalier Nigra, of whom
Prosper Mérimée once said in my presence: 'C'est un
bohème tombé dans la diplomatie.' Withal, Chevalier Nigra—who,
though very aged, still serves his country, I believe,
with distinction at Vienna—was a very good diplomatist
indeed; one of Cavour's right-hand men, one of those to
whom Italy owes union and liberty. And what a career was
his in France, and what memoirs might he not write! Few
diplomatists ever had stranger experiences: from all the
secret plotting which so largely helped to make Victor
Emmanuel King of Italy to the surveillance so adroitly practised
over the Empress Eugénie, whose support of Pope
Pius IX. was ever an obstacle to Italian aspirations. For
her Nigra-Rusconi became the handsome, gallant courtier;
he was a musician, could sing and dance, was proficient in
every society accomplishment, and before long the Empress's
Monday receptions at the Tuileries, those <i>petits Lundis</i> enlivened
by the wit of Mérimée, were never complete without
him. Yet, all the time, a stern duel was being fought
between him and the consort of Napoleon III. And so long
as her husband ruled France she kept her adversary at bay.
Rome, capital of Italy, was but the fruit of Sedan. Yet
Nigra was chivalrous. When the bitter hour of reckoning
arrived, he stood by the woman who had so long thwarted
him. He and Prince Richard Metternich smuggled her out
of the Tuileries in order that she might escape to England,
beyond the reach of the infuriated Parisians.</p>

<p>We catch a few glimpses of the Empress in the pages
of <i>His Excellency</i>. We find her at Compiègne surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
by the ladies of her Court; we also see her riding in state
to Notre Dame to attend the baptism of her infant son. A
great day it was, when the Empire reached its zenith: a
gorgeous ceremony, too, attended by every pomp. On referring
to the newspapers of the time I have found M. Zola's
description of the function to be remarkably accurate. We
espy the Man of December raising the Prince Imperial in his
arms, presenting the heir of the Napoleons to the assembled
multitude—even as once before, and in the same cathedral,
the victor of Austerlitz presented the infant King of Rome to
the homage of France. But neither the son of Marie-Louise
nor the son of Eugénie de Montijo was destined to reign.
And what a mockery now seems that grand baptismal ceremony,
as well as all the previous discussion in the Corps
Législatif, of which M. Zola gives such an animated account.
What a lesson, too, for human pride, and, in the sequel,
what a punishment for human perversity! I often read, I
often hear, words of compassion for the Prince Imperial's
widowed mother, but they cannot move me to pity, for I
think of all the hundreds, all the thousands, of mothers who
lost their sons in that most wicked and abominable of wars
in the declaration of which the Empress Eugénie played so
prominent a part. Her evil influence triumphed in that hour
of indecision which came upon her ailing husband; and her
war—<i>ma guerre à moi</i>—ensued, with fatal consequences,
which even yet disturb the world. And so, however great,
however bitter, her punishment, who will dare to say that it
was undeserved?</p>

<p>But whilst I consider the Empress to have been, in more
than one momentous circumstance, the evil genius of France,
even as Marie Antoinette was the evil genius of the crumbling
Legitimate monarchy, I am not one of those who believe
in all the malicious reports of her to be found in <i>la chronique
scandaleuse</i>. That she threw herself at the Emperor's head
and compelled him to marry her, may be true, but that is all
that can be alleged against her with any show of reason.
She undoubtedly proved a faithful wife to a man who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
notoriously a most unfaithful husband. There are those who
may yet remember how one November morning in the year
1860 the Empress arrived in London, scarcely attended,
drove in a growler to Claridge's Hotel, and thence hurried
off to Scotland. Her flight from the Tuileries had caused
consternation there. For four days the <i>Moniteur</i> remained
ominously silent, and when it at last spoke out it was to
announce with the utmost brevity that her Majesty was in
very delicate health, and had betaken herself to Scotland—in
November!—for a change of air. This ridiculous explanation
deceived nobody. The simple truth was that the
Empress had obtained proof positive of another of her
husband's infidelities.</p>

<p>It is needless for me to enlarge upon the subject; I have
only mentioned it in corroboration of the portrait of
Napoleon III. which M. Zola traces in <i>His Excellency</i>.
The Emperor was an immoral man—the Beauharnais if not
the Bonaparte blood coursed in his veins—and the names of
several of his mistresses are perfectly well known. For the
rest, M. Zola pictures him very accurately: moody, reserved,
with vague humanitarian notions, and as great a predilection
for secret police spying as was evinced by Louis XV. The
intrigue between him and M. Zola's heroine, Clorinde, is no
extravagant notion. Here again a large amount of actual
fact is skilfully blended with a little fiction. Clorinde Balbi
at once suggests the beautiful Countess de Castiglione; but
in the account of her earlier career one finds a suggestion of
the behaviour which innumerable scandalmongers impute—wrongly,
I believe—to the Empress Eugénie. In Clorinde's
mother, the Contessa Balbi, there is more than a suggestion
of Madame de Montijo, who was undoubtedly an adventuress
of good birth. Both the Balbis are very cleverly drawn;
they typify a class of women that has long flourished in
France, where it still has some notorious representatives.
It is a class of great popularity with novelists and playwrights,
possibly because contemporary history has furnished so many
examples of it, from the aforementioned Countess de Castiglione<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
who laid siege to Napoleon III. in order to induce him
to further the designs of Cavour and Victor Emmanuel, to
the Baroness de Kaulla, who ensnared poor General de Cissey
that she might extract from him the military and Foreign
Office secrets of France. And with half-a-dozen historical
instances in my mind, I find no exaggeration in the character
of Clorinde as portrayed in <i>His Excellency</i>.</p>

<p>Having thus passed M. Zola's personages in review, I
would now refer to the actual scenes which he describes.
The account of the sitting of the Corps Législatif, given in
the opening chapter, is as accurate as the official report in the
<i>Moniteur</i> of that time. The report on the estimates for the
baptism of the Prince Imperial is taken from the <i>Moniteur</i>
verbatim. In Chapter III., when the Balbis are shown at
home, the description of the house in the Champs Élysées is
assuredly that of the famous <i>niche à Fidèle</i>. The baptism,
described in Chapter IV., is, as I have already mentioned,
very faithfully dealt with. I have by me an account of the
day's proceedings written for the <i>Illustrated Times</i> by my
uncle, the late Frank Vizetelly, who was killed in the Soudan;
and I find him laying stress on the very points which M. Zola
brings into prominence, often indeed using almost the same
words. However, this is but one of the curious coincidences
on which malicious critics found ridiculous charges of
plagiarism; for I am convinced that M. Zola never saw the
<i>Illustrated Times</i> in his life, and moreover he knows no
English. Passing to Chapter V., which narrates the horse-whipping
administered by Clorinde to Rougon—an incident
which it has been necessary to 'tone down' in this English
version—I may remark that this is founded on contemporary
scandal, according to which the true scene of the affair would
be the Imperial stables at Compiègne, and the recipient of
the whipping none other than Napoleon III. himself. In
Chapter VI., the scheme for reclaiming the waste Landes of
Gascony is well-known matter of history. Suggested to the
Emperor, this scheme was ultimately taken up by him with
considerable vigour, and though it was never fully carried out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
it may rank as one of the few really beneficent enterprises of
the Imperial <i>régime</i>.</p>

<p>In the ensuing chapter we come to Compiègne, and here
I have found nothing to call in question. I was twice at
Compiègne myself under the Empire, of course not as a guest,
but in connection with work for the <i>Illustrated London News</i>,
which brought my father and myself into constant intercourse
with the Imperial Court over a term of years. And, judging
by my personal recollections, I consider M. Zola's picture of
life at Compiègne to be a very true one. He has been attacked,
however, for having based his descriptions on a work
called <i>Les Confidences d'un Valet de Chambre</i>. Some few
years ago Mr. Andrew Lang, in criticising the French original
of <i>His Excellency</i> in an English review, sternly reproved
M. Zola for relying, in any degree, upon such back-stairs
gossip. But a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Whatever
its title may be, <i>Les Confidences d'un Valet de Chambre</i>
was not written by a <i>valet de chambre</i> at all. I have a copy
of it among my collection of books relating to the Empire.
It is brimful of information, bald in style, but severely accurate.
As for its authorship, these are the facts: The Court's
sojourn at Compiègne, which lasted for a month or six weeks
every autumn—having been suggested in part by the <i>Voyages
à Fontainebleau</i> of the <i>ancien régime</i>, and in part by the
Empress's partiality for the place where she had been wooed
and won by Napoleon—had long been the subject of tittle-tattle
among the Parisians. The newspapers dared not publish
any of the current scandal for fear of being immediately
suppressed; however, the impression prevailed, especially
among the lower classes, that the Court only betook itself to
Compiègne to indulge in a month's orgie far from such prying
eyes as might have spied upon any similar excesses at the
Tuileries. So many reports circulated, that it was at last
deemed expedient to give the <i>entrée</i> to the château to a Court
chronicler, who should report what actually took place there,
and in this way show the Parisians how foolish were the
stories circulated through the cafés and wine-shops. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
<i>soi-disant valet de chambre</i> was then, purely and simply, a
journalist recommended by Théophile Gautier; and his
accounts of the Court at Compiègne were published, in part
at all events, by the Paris <i>Figaro</i>, and were subsequently
collected in volume form. There is no scandal of any kind
in the book: it simply chronicles the day's doings, with descriptions
of the various rooms of the château, and accounts
of certain Court customs thrown in here and there. Nobody
desirous of describing life in Imperial circles at second-hand
could do without this little volume, and it is only natural that
M. Zola should have consulted it. Its general accuracy I can,
by personal knowledge, fully confirm. Among the various
incidents which M. Zola has adapted from it I may mention
that of the aged dignitary who fondles first the Prince Imperial
and afterwards the Emperor's dog Nero. This aged
dignitary is a little bit of invention, the real hero of the incident
having been a certain M. Leciel, an <i>adjoint</i> to the Mayor
of Compiègne, who subsequently got into hot water with the
Empress owing to his partiality for irreverent witticisms
which usually turned upon his own name. In English we
might have called him Mr. Heaven. His residence at Compiègne
adjoined the somewhat dirty little inn of the Holy
Ghost, which it was at one time proposed to demolish in order
to build a new theatre, which was to have been connected
with the château by means of a suspension bridge. This
gave M. Leciel an opportunity for a most deplorable pun
concerning himself and the inn, which he calmly repeated
to the Empress, who was considerably incensed thereat.
And in the result M. Leciel received no further invitations to
the château.</p>

<p>But I must pass from Compiègne to M. Zola's next
chapter, in which he deals, indirectly, with the famous Orsini
conspiracy. Here we find a story of how the authorities were
warned of the approaching attempt at assassination—a story
which I have heard told by M. Claude, the famous ex-chief of
the detective police, when I was his neighbour at Vincennes
in 1881. Something similar, I believe, figures in the so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
<i>Mémoires de M. Claude</i>, but these, based on Claude's
papers, which were 'worked up' after his death by an imaginative
penny-a-liner, are worthy of little or no credence. It
is, however, certain that the French authorities were not only
warned from London about the Orsini plot, but obtained additional
information in the manner described by M. Zola, and
that the incident became the stepping-stone of Claude's subsequent
fortune. In <i>His Excellency</i> the Orsini affair is
followed by Rougon's return to power. For Rougon one
should here read General Espinasse, to whom the Emperor
undoubtedly addressed the words: 'No moderation; you
must make yourself feared.' All that M. Zola says of the
wholesale arrests of French Republicans at that time is quite
true. Even the brief interview of the Prefect of the Somme
with Rougon is based on historical documents; while that in
which figures the editor whose newspaper publishes a story
of feminine infidelity is derived from the autobiography of
Henri de Villemessant.</p>

<p>In Chapter X., which deals with Rougon's experiences at
Niort, we have the story of the arrest of the old notary Martineau.
This, again, is true, line for line, almost word for
word; but the incident really occurred at Charost, not Coulonges,
and the notary's real name was Lebrun. He was a
cousin of the illustrious parliamentarian, Michel of Bourges.
And once again, fact is piled upon fact in Chapter XI., which
describes the Ministerial Council at St. Cloud. The project
for the creation of a new nobility emanated from Persigny
and Magne; numerous documents concerning it were discovered
in the Emperor's study after Sedan; and I may here
remark <i>en passant</i> that M. Zola has frequently and rightly
availed himself of those <i>Papiers trouvés aux Tuileries</i> as published
by the Government of National Defence. And he carries
accuracy to such a point that in Chapter XIII., when he is
describing Rougon's resignation, he dates the Emperor's
acceptance of it from Fontainebleau, as actually happened in
the case of Espinasse; and gives us a charity fair at the
orangery of the Tuileries as the scene of the minister's receipt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
of that acceptance—again an historical incident. And finally,
in the last chapter, which, like the opening one, deals with
the Corps Législatif, we read the very words of Jules Favre
and Billault. Moreover, when we here find a clerical deputy
exclaiming, 'It displeases me that proud Venice, the Queen
of the Adriatic, should become the obscure vassal of Turin,'
we must not attribute the remark to M. Zola's imagination;
for those words were spoken in that very debate by Kolb.
Bernard, who, with Vicomte Lemercier, led the parliamentary
group which opposed the Emperor's liberal policy in Italy.</p>

<p>Some readers and some reviewers may think that I have
acted somewhat unkindly to M. Zola in thus partially dissecting
<i>Son Excellence Eugène Rougon</i>, in showing how little it is a
work of imagination and how much a work based upon fact.
I could have given many more instances than those I have
quoted, but this preface has already stretched to such length
that I must stay my hand. I would mention, however, that I
could in a similar way dissect most volumes of the Rougon-Macquart
series, for these books are novels in their arrangement
only. Even when they do not deal with historical
personages and publicly recorded facts, they are based on
incidents which really happened, and more frequently than
otherwise portray people who really lived. The whole series
constitutes a truthful, life-like synthesis of a period; and if
certain readers recoil from some of the portraits contained in
it, this is simply because they will not face the monstrosities of
human life. And far from doing my good and clear friend,
the author of this imperishable literary edifice, an unkindness
by pointing out where and how he has borrowed and adapted,
I conceive that I am rendering him a service, for how often
has not his accuracy been impugned! Moreover, it is not
upon power of imagination that he particularly prides himself—though
imagination, and of a high order, is undoubtedly a
feature of his genius—he claims rank chiefly by reason of his
power of delineation, his power of analysing, blending and
grouping facts and characteristics. In one word, he is a
Realist. And if he is to describe people as they have lived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
incidents as they have really occurred, how can he do otherwise
than turn to the records of actual experience, to the
unchallenged descriptions of historical episodes? Plagiarism
forsooth! When every situation, every dilemma, every
experience, every characteristic and every emotion that can
enter into the history of the human race have been dealt with
time without number by thousands of writers of fiction, either
in the form of the novel or the drama! How, then, is it
possible for anybody, however great his genius, to be
absolutely and perfectly original? Such originality is dead.
Let us bow to its grave; we shall never see it more. The
only genius in literature which can remain to the writers
of to-day and to-morrow is that genius which may lie in the
handling of one's materials. The human range of ideas is
limited; even madmen—so closely allied to men of genius—cannot
carry their fancy beyond certain bounds; and thus
the old saws must crop up again and again, distinguished one
from another simply by mode of treatment. And as for such
charges of plagiarism that may have been brought against
M. Zola, I apply to him the words which Molière applied
to himself: <i>Il prend son bien où il le trouve</i>. And I will add
that he does well in following this course, for over all he
casts the magnificent mantle of powers which none of his
contemporaries can equal.<br>

<h3>I</h3>

<h3>THE CORPS LÉGISLATIF</h3>


<p>For a moment the President remained standing amidst the
slight commotion which his entrance had caused. Then he
took his seat, saying carelessly and in an undertone: 'The
sitting has commenced.'</p>

<p>He next began to arrange the legislative bills lying upon
the desk in front of him. On his left, a short-sighted clerk,
with his nose close to the paper he held, read the minutes of
the previous sitting in a rapid and confused manner, none of
the deputies paying attention to him. In the buzzing noise
that filled the Chamber, these minutes were only heard by the
ushers, who maintained a very dignified and decorous bearing
which contrasted with the lounging attitudes of the deputies.</p>

<p>There were not a hundred members present. Some were
reclining in their red velvet-covered seats, with listless eyes,
already half-asleep. Others, leaning over their desks, as
though wearied by the compulsory labour of a public sitting,
were beating a gentle tattoo on the mahogany with their
finger-tips. Through the ceiling-window, which revealed a
crescent of grey sky, the light of a rainy May afternoon
streamed down perpendicularly upon the pompous severity of
the Chamber. It spread over the desks in a sheet of gloomy
ruddiness, brightening into a rosy glow here and there where
some seat remained unoccupied; while, behind the President,
the statues and sculpture-work showed in clear white patches.</p>

<p>One of the deputies on the third row to the right still
remained standing in the narrow passage between the seats.
He was rubbing his rough fringe of grizzly beard with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
thoughtful air, but as an usher came by, he stopped him and
asked a question in an undertone.</p>

<p>'No, Monsieur Kahn,' replied the usher, 'the President of
the Council of State has not yet arrived.'</p>

<p>M. Kahn thereupon sat down, and, abruptly turning to his
neighbour on the left, inquired, 'Tell me, Béjuin, have you seen
Rougon this morning?'</p>

<p>M. Béjuin, a small, thin man of dark complexion and
silent demeanour, raised his head nervously as though his
thoughts were altogether elsewhere. He had drawn out
the slide of his desk, and was writing a letter on some
blue paper with a business heading formed of these words:
'Béjuin and Co. The Saint-Florent Cut-Glass Works.'</p>

<p>'Rougon?' he repeated. 'No, I haven't seen him. I did
not have time to go over to the State Council.'</p>

<p>Then he quietly reverted to his work, consulting a
memorandum-book, and beginning a second letter, amidst the
confused buzzing murmur of the clerk, who was finishing his
reading of the minutes.</p>

<p>M. Kahn leant back in his seat and crossed his arms. He
had a face with strongly marked features, and his big but well-shaped
nose testified to a Jewish descent. He seemed out of
sorts. He gazed upwards at the gilt rose-work on the ceiling
and listened to the plashing of a shower which at that
moment burst down upon the skylight; and then with
vaguely wondering eyes he seemed to be examining the
intricate ornamentation of the great wall in front of him.
His glance lingered for a few seconds upon two panels hung
with green velvet and decked with gilt borders and emblems.
Then, after he had scanned the columns between which
allegorical statues of Liberty and Public Order showed their
marble faces and pupil-less eyes, his attention was turned to
a curtain of green silk which concealed a fresco representing
King Louis Philippe taking the oath to the Constitution.</p>

<p>By this time the clerk had sat down; nevertheless, the scene
remained one of noisy confusion. The President was still
leisurely arranging his papers. He again and again pressed
his hand on his bell, but its loud ringing failed to check any
of the private conversations that were going on. However,
he at last stood up amidst all the hubbub and for a moment
remained waiting and silent.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' he began, 'I have received a letter——' Then
he stopped short to ring his bell again, and once more kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
silent, his grave, bored face looking down from the monumental
desk which spread out beneath him with panels of red
marble bordered with white. His frock-coat, which was
buttoned up, showed conspicuously against the bas-relief
behind him, rising like a black bar between the peplum-robed
figures of Agriculture and Industry with antique profiles.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' he resumed, when he had succeeded in
obtaining something like silence, 'I have received a letter
from Monsieur de Lamberthon, in which he apologises for not
being able to attend to-day's sitting.'</p>

<p>At this a laugh resounded on the sixth row of seats in
front of the desk. It came from a deputy who could not
have been more than twenty-eight years old. He was fair
and effeminately pretty, and was trying with his white hands
to stifle an outburst of girlish rippling laughter. One of his
colleagues, a man of huge build, came up to him and
whispered in his ear: 'Is it really true that Lamberthon has
found his wife? Tell me all about it, La Rouquette.'</p>

<p>The President, however, had taken up a handful of papers.
He was speaking in monotonous tones, and stray fragments
of sentences reached the far end of the Chamber. 'There
are applications for leave of absence from Monsieur Blachet,
Monsieur Buquin-Lecomte, Monsieur de la Villardière—'</p>

<p>While the Chamber was granting these different requests,
M. Kahn, who had probably grown weary of examining the
green silk curtain stretched before the seditious portrait of Louis
Philippe, turned to glance at the galleries. Above the wall
of yellow marble veined with lake red, there was a gallery
with hand-rests of amaranthine velvet spanning the spaces
from one column to another; and higher up a mantle of
embossed leather failed to conceal the gaps left by the
suppression of a second tier of seats which had been assigned
to journalists and the general public previous to the Empire.
The narrow, gloomy boxes between the massive yellowish
marble pillars, which stood in somewhat heavy splendour
round the semicircle, were for the most part empty, although
here and there they were brightened by the light-tinted
toilettes of some ladies.</p>

<p>'Ah! so Colonel Jobelin has come!' murmured M. Kahn.</p>

<p>And forthwith he smiled at the colonel, who had perceived
him. Colonel Jobelin was wearing the dark-blue frock-coat
which he had adopted as a kind of civilian uniform ever since
his retirement from the service. He sat quite alone in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
questors' gallery, and his rosette as an officer of the Legion
of Honour was so large as to look almost like the bow of a
cravat.</p>

<p>But M. Kahn's eyes had already strayed to a young man
and woman who were nestling in a corner of the gallery of
the Council of State. The young man was continually bending
his head and whispering to the young woman, who smiled
with a gentle air, but did not turn to look at him, her eyes
being fixed upon the allegorical figure of Public Order.</p>

<p>'I say, Béjuin,' M. Kahn remarked, nudging his colleague
with his knee.</p>

<p>M. Béjuin, who was now busy with his fifth letter, again
raised his head with an expression of absent-mindedness.</p>

<p>'Look up there,' continued M. Kahn; 'don't you see little
Escorailles and pretty Madame Bouchard? I'll be bound he's
making love to her. What eyes she's got! All Rougon's
friends seem to have made a point of coming to-day. There's
Madame Correur and the Charbonnels up there in the public
gallery.'</p>

<p>However, the bell sounded again for some moments, and
an usher called out in a fine bass voice: 'Silence, gentlemen!'</p>

<p>Then the deputies began to listen, and the President spoke
the following words, not a syllable of which was lost: 'Monsieur
Kahn asks permission to publish the speech which he delivered
on the bill for the establishment of a municipal tax upon
vehicles and horses in Paris.'</p>

<p>A murmur ran along the benches, and then the different
conversations were resumed. Quitting his own place, M. La
Rouquette came and sat down near M. Kahn. 'So you work
for the people, eh?' he said playfully, and, without waiting
for a reply, he added: 'You haven't seen or heard anything
of Rougon, have you? Everyone is talking about the matter,
but it seems that nothing is definitely settled yet.' Then he
turned round and glanced at the clock. 'Twenty minutes
past two already!' he exclaimed. 'Well, I should certainly
be off now, if it were not for the reading of that confounded
report. Is it really to come off to-day?'</p>

<p>'We have all been notified to that effect,' M. Kahn replied,
'and I have heard nothing of any change of plans. You had
better remain. The 400,000 francs<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for the baptism will be
voted straight off.'</p>

<p>'No doubt,' said La Rouquette. 'Old General Legrain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
who has lost the use of both legs, has had himself carried
here by his servant, and is now in the Conference Hall waiting
till the vote comes on. The Emperor is quite right in
reckoning upon the devotion of the whole Corps Législatif.
All our votes ought to be given him upon this solemn occasion.'</p>

<p>While speaking the young deputy did his utmost to assume
the expression of a serious politician. His doll-like face,
which was ornamented by a few pale hairs, wagged gravely
over his collar, and he seemed to be relishing the flavour of
the two last sentences he had uttered—sentences which he had
remembered from somebody else's speech. Then he suddenly
broke into a laugh. 'Good gracious!' he exclaimed, 'what
frights those Charbonnels are!'</p>

<p>M. Kahn and himself thereupon began to make merry at
the Charbonnels' expense. The wife was wearing an outrageous
yellow shawl, and her husband sported a country-cut
frock-coat which looked as though it had been hewn into
shape with an axe. They were both very short, stout and red,
and were eagerly pressing forward, with their chins almost
resting upon the balustrade of the gallery in order to get a
better view of the proceedings, which, judging by their blank,
staring eyes, were utterly unintelligible to them.</p>

<p>'If Rougon gets the sack,' said La Rouquette, 'I wouldn't
give a couple of sous for the Charbonnels' case. It will be
just the same with Madame Correur.' Then he inclined his
head towards M. Kahn's ear, and continued in a very low
tone: 'You, now, who know Rougon, just tell me who and
what that Madame Correur is. She formerly kept a lodging-house,
didn't she? Rougon used to lodge with her, and it
is even said that she lent him money. What does she do
now?'</p>

<p>M. Kahn assumed a very grave expression and slowly
rubbed his beard. 'Madame Correur is a highly respectable
lady,' he replied curtly.</p>

<p>This answer checked La Rouquette's curiosity. He bit his
lips with the expression of a school-boy who has just been
lectured. For a moment they both looked in silence at
Madame Correur, who was sitting near the Charbonnels. She
was wearing a very showy dress of mauve silk, with a profusion
of lace and ornaments. Her face showed too much colour, her
forehead was covered with little fair dollish curls, and her
plump neck, still very comely in spite of her eight-and-forty
years, was fully exposed to view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Just at this moment, however, the sudden sound of a door
opening and a rustle of skirts at the far end of the Chamber
caused all heads to turn. A tall girl exquisitely beautiful, but
strangely dressed in an ill-made sea-green satin gown, had
entered the box assigned to the diplomatic body, followed by
an elderly lady in black.</p>

<p>'Ah! there's the fair Clorinde!' said M. La Rouquette,
who had risen to bow at random.</p>

<p>M. Kahn had also risen; but he stooped towards M. Béjuin,
who was now enclosing his letters in envelopes: 'Countess
Balbi and her daughter are there,' he said. 'I am going up
to ask them if they have seen Rougon.'</p>

<p>The President meanwhile had taken a fresh handful of
papers from his desk. Without ceasing his perusal of them
he cast a glance at the beautiful Clorinde Balbi, whose arrival
had given rise to a buzz of comments in the Chamber.
Then, while he passed the papers one by one to a clerk, he
said in monotonous tones, never even pausing to punctuate
his words: 'Presentation of a bill to continue certain extra
duties in the town of Lille ... of a bill to unite into one single
commune the communes of Doulevant-le-Petit and Ville-en-Blaisais
(Haute-Marne)——'</p>

<p>When M. Kahn came back again he seemed quite disconsolate.
'Really, no one appears to have seen anything of him,'
he said to his colleagues, Béjuin and La Rouquette, whom he
met at the foot of the semicircle. 'I hear that the Emperor
sent for him yesterday evening, but I haven't been able to
learn the result of their interview. There is nothing so
provoking as being unable to get a satisfactory account of
what happens.'</p>

<p>La Rouquette turned round and whispered into M.
Béjuin's ear: 'Poor Kahn is terribly afraid lest Rougon
should get into disfavour at the Tuileries. He might fish for
his railway if that should occur.'</p>

<p>In reply M. Béjuin, who was of a taciturn disposition, said
very gravely: 'The day when Rougon retires from the Council
of State, we shall all be losers.' Then he beckoned to one of
the ushers and gave him the letters which he had just written,
to post.</p>

<p>The three deputies remained standing on the left of the
President's desk, discreetly discussing the disfavour with which
Rougon was threatened. It was an intricate story. A distant
relation of the Empress, one Señor Rodriguez, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
claiming a sum of two million francs from the French Government
since the year 1808. During the war with Spain, a
vessel freighted with sugar and coffee, and belonging to this
Rodriguez, who was a shipowner, had been taken in the Bay
of Biscay by a French frigate, the <i>Vigilante</i>, and brought to
Brest. Acting upon information received from a local commission,
the administrative officials had declared the capture
to be a valid one, without referring the matter to the Prize
Committee. Rodriguez, however, had promptly appealed to
the Council of State, and, after his death, his son, under every
successive Government, had vainly tried to bring the matter
to an issue until the day came when a word from his distant
cousin, Eugénie de Montijo, now all-powerful, had secured
the insertion of his action in the official cause list.</p>

<p>Of this the three deputies talked, while the President's
monotonous voice still resounded above their heads: 'Presentation
of a bill authorising the department of Calvados to borrow
300,000 francs ... of a bill authorising the town of Amiens
to borrow 200,000 francs for the purpose of making new
promenades ... of a bill authorising the department of Côtes-du-Nord
to borrow 345,000 francs to cover the deficiencies in
the revenues of the last five years.'</p>

<p>'The truth is,' said M. Kahn, again lowering his voice,
'that this Rodriguez had a very artful method of managing
his business. He and a son-in-law of his, residing at New York,
were the owners of vessels which sailed either under the
American flag or the Spanish, according as one or the other
might subject them to the least risk during their passage.
Rougon told me that the captured vessel was exclusively the
property of Rodriguez, and that there is no valid ground
whatever for the claims that are made.'</p>

<p>'And then,' interposed M. Béjuin, 'the steps that were
taken by the officials cannot be impugned. The administrative
officer at Brest was perfectly right in declaring the capture a
valid one in accordance with the customs of the port, without
referring the matter to the Prize Committee.'</p>

<p>Then they lapsed into silence for a moment while
La Rouquette, with his back resting against the marble wall,
raised his head, and tried to attract the attention of the fair
Clorinde. 'But,' he asked naïvely, 'why does Rougon object
to the two millions being paid to Rodriguez? What difference
would it make to him?'</p>

<p>'It is a matter of conscience,' said M. Kahn solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>M. La Rouquette glanced at his colleagues one after the
other, but, seeing them both so grave, he did not even venture
to smile.</p>

<p>'Then, too,' continued M. Kahn, as though he were
dwelling upon some thought which he had not expressed
aloud, 'Rougon has had a good deal of bother since Marsy
has been Minister of the Interior. They have never been able
to get on together. Rougon himself told me that, if it had
not been for his attachment to the Emperor, for whom he has
already done so much, he would long ago have retired into
private life. He no longer seems welcome at the Tuileries,
and he feels that a change has become necessary for him.'</p>

<p>'He is acting like an honourable man,' remarked M.
Béjuin.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' said M. La Rouquette, with a wise look, 'if
he wants to retire, the opportunity is a good one. All the
same, his friends will be greatly grieved. Just look at the
colonel up there, with his anxious face! He has been hoping
to fasten the ribbon of Commander of the Legion of Honour
round his neck on the 15th of next August. And pretty
Madame Bouchard, too, swore that worthy Monsieur Bouchard
should be head of department at the Ministry of the
Interior before six months were over. Little Escorailles,
Rougon's pet, was to put the nomination under Monsieur
Bouchard's napkin on Madame's birthday. But where have
they got to, pretty Madame Bouchard and little Escorailles?'</p>

<p>The three deputies looked about for them, and at last
discovered them ensconced at the back of the gallery, in the
front part of which they had been seated at the opening of
the sitting. They had taken refuge in the gloom there behind
a bald old gentleman, and were both very quiet, though very
red.</p>

<p>However, the President was now coming to the end of his
reading.</p>

<p>'A bill,' said he, 'to sanction an increase in the rate of
interest upon a loan authorised by an Act of the 9th of June,
1853, and to impose an extraordinary rate in the department
of La Manche.'</p>

<p>Just then M. Kahn ran forward to meet a deputy who was
entering the Chamber, and as he brought him along he
exclaimed, 'Here is Monsieur de Combelot. He will give us
some news.'</p>

<p>M. de Combelot, an imperial chamberlain whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
department of the Landes had chosen as deputy upon the
formally expressed desire of the Emperor, bowed with a
discreet air while waiting to be questioned. He was a tall,
handsome man, with a very white skin, and an inky black
beard which had been the means of winning him great favour
among the ladies.</p>

<p>'Well,' asked M. Kahn, 'what do they say at the Tuileries?
What has the Emperor decided upon?'</p>

<p>'Well, indeed,' replied M. de Combelot in a guttural tone,
'they say a good many things. The Emperor has the
warmest friendship for the President of the Council of State.
Their interview was undoubtedly of the most cordial nature.
Yes, indeed, most cordial.'</p>

<p>Then he stopped, after carefully weighing his words,
as it were, so as to satisfy himself that he had not said
too much.</p>

<p>'Then the resignation is withdrawn?' asked M. Kahn,
with glistening eyes.</p>

<p>'I did not say that,' replied the chamberlain, uneasily.
'I know nothing about it. You understand that my position
is a peculiar one——'</p>

<p>He did not finish what he was going to say, but contented
himself with smiling, and then hurried off to take his seat.
M. Kahn shrugged his shoulders, and remarked to M. La
Rouquette, 'But you, surely, ought to be posted on what is
going on. Doesn't your sister, Madame de Llorentz, give you
any information?'</p>

<p>'Oh, my sister is even more reserved than Monsieur de
Combelot,' replied the young deputy, with a laugh. 'Since
she has become one of the ladies-in-waiting, she has put on
quite a minister's gravity; though yesterday, indeed, she
assured me that the resignation would be accepted. By the
way, I can tell you a funny story in connection with this
matter. It appears that some lady was sent to Rougon to
try to influence him. Now, you would never guess what
Rougon did! He turned her out of doors, although she was a
delicious creature!'</p>

<p>'Rougon is a very steady fellow,' M. Béjuin declared
solemnly.</p>

<p>M. La Rouquette shook with laughter, and, protesting
against M. Béjuin's estimate of Rougon, asserted that he
could have disproved it by evidence had he chosen. 'And so,
Madame Correur, for instance,' said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>'Pooh! you don't know the truth of that story,' replied
M. Kahn.</p>

<p>'And the fair Clorinde?'</p>

<p>'Nonsense, nonsense! Rougon is much too clever a fellow
to forget himself with such a wild creature as that!'</p>

<p>Then the three men drew closer, and talked on without any
mincing of words. They repeated the stories which were
told about those two Italian women—mother and daughter—who
were semi-adventuresses and semi-great ladies, and were
to be met everywhere, at all parties and gatherings, at the
houses of state ministers, in the stage-boxes of minor
theatres, on the sands at fashionable watering-places, and
even in out-of-the-way hostelries. The mother, it was said,
had been the mistress of a royal personage; and the daughter,
with an ignorance of French customs and etiquette which
had earned her the reputation of being an eccentric, badly
brought-up wench, galloped about on horseback till she
foundered her mounts, made a display of her dirty stockings
and damaged boots on rainy days, and looked around her for
a husband with the boldest of smiles. M. La Rouquette told
how she had come one night to a ball at the Sardinian
Minister's, in the character of the huntress Diana, with so
scanty a costume that she had been all but asked in marriage
the next morning by old Monsieur de Nougarède, a profligate
senator. During the narration of this story, the three
deputies cast frequent glances at the fair Clorinde, who, in
spite of the regulations, was examining the members of the
Chamber one after another through a large pair of opera-glasses.</p>

<p>'No, no!' M. Kahn repeated, 'Rougon would never be
such a fool! He says, though, that she is very intelligent,
and he has nicknamed her "Mademoiselle Machiavelli." She
amuses him, but that's all.'</p>

<p>'At the same time Rougon is wrong in not marrying,' said
M. Béjuin. 'It settles a man.'</p>

<p>Then they all three set to work to discuss the sort of
woman that it was desirable Rougon should marry. She
ought to be a woman of some age, thirty-five at the least, they
said, rich, and competent to maintain her house on a footing
of high decorum.</p>

<p>Hubbub still prevailed in the Chamber, and the three
deputies became so absorbed in the stories they were telling,
that they ceased to notice what was taking place around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
them. Away in the distance, the voices of ushers could be
faintly heard calling out, 'To the sitting, gentlemen, to the
sitting.'</p>

<p>Fresh deputies were entering from all sides by way of the
folding doors of massive mahogany, whose panels gleamed
with golden stars. The Chamber, previously half empty,
was now gradually filling. The little scattered groups of
members talking to each other from one row of seats to
another, with an expression of weariness on their faces, or
dozing, or trying to conceal their yawns, were now disappearing
amid the increasing crowd and general shaking of hands.
As the members took their seats, they exchanged smiles;
there was a general, almost family likeness about them. By
the expression of their faces one and all seemed impressed by
the duties they had to fulfil. A stout man, on the last row to
the left, had fallen asleep, but was awakened by his neighbour;
and, when the latter whispered a few words in his ear, he
hastily rubbed his eyes, and assumed a more decorous attitude.
The sitting, after dragging on wearily through a series
of petty tedious details, was at last about to become supremely
interesting.</p>

<p>M. Kahn and his two colleagues were being gradually
driven towards their seats by the increasing crowd, almost
without being aware of it. They went on with their conversation,
every now and then suppressing a laugh. M. La Rouquette
began a fresh story about the fair Clorinde. She had taken
a strange whim into her head one day, he said; it was to have
her room hung with black, spangled with silver tears, and to
hold a reception of her friends there; she herself lying in bed,
covered up with black drapery which allowed scarcely anything
more than her nose to appear.</p>

<p>As M. Kahn at last took his seat, his memory suddenly
returned to him. 'La Rouquette is a foolish chatterbox,' he
muttered; 'he has made me miss Rougon.' Then he turned
towards his neighbour and exclaimed angrily. 'You really
might have reminded me, Béjuin!'</p>

<p>Rougon, who had just been introduced with the customary
ceremonial, had already taken his seat between two members
of the Council of State on the Government bench, a sort of
huge mahogany box, situated beneath the President's desk
and occupying the place of the suppressed tribune. His broad
shoulders tightly distended his uniform of green cloth, ornamented
with gold braid at the neck and sleeve-cuffs. His face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
with thick grizzly hair clustering over his square brow, was
turned towards the Chamber, but his eyes were hidden by their
heavy drooping lids. The commonplace plainness of his
big nose, fleshy lips, and long cheeks, which his six-and-forty
years had not yet furrowed with a single wrinkle, was every
now and then irradiated with something like beauty by an
expression of great strength. He sat perfectly quiet, leaning
back with his chin resting on his coat collar, noticing nobody,
and seeming quite indifferent and a little weary.</p>

<p>'He looks just as he does every day,' M. Béjuin remarked.</p>

<p>The deputies were all leaning over to observe Rougon.
Whispered remarks on his appearance buzzed from ear to ear.
In the galleries especially his entrance had caused lively
excitement. The Charbonnels, in their desire to let their
presence be known, craned their enraptured faces forward at
the risk of falling over; Madame Correur coughed slightly
and drew out a handkerchief which she gently waved, while
pretending to carry it to her lips; Colonel Jobelin straightened
himself; and pretty Madame Bouchard, after tying her bonnet-strings
afresh, again hurried down to the front row of the
State Council gallery, while M. d'Escorailles remained behind
quite still and seemingly much annoyed. As for the fair
Clorinde, she did not beat about the bush. Seeing that Rougon
did not raise his eyes, she began to tap her opera-glass against
the marble column beside which she was leaning, and as these
tactics did not succeed in attracting his attention, she said to
her mother, in such a clear ringing voice that every one in the
Chamber heard her: 'He's in the sulks, the fat sly fellow!'</p>

<p>Several deputies looked round and smiled, and Rougon
himself glanced up at the fair Clorinde. As he nodded his
head almost imperceptibly towards her, she triumphantly
clapped her hands, and leant back, laughing and talking quite
loudly to her mother, quite careless of the men down below
who were staring at her.</p>

<p>Before Rougon dropped his eyes again he glanced slowly
round the gallery, where his comprehensive gaze at once took
in Madame Bouchard, Colonel Jobelin, Madame Correur, and
the Charbonnels. However, his face remained expressionless.
He again let his chin drop and half-closed his eyes as he
stifled a slight yawn.</p>

<p>'I'll go and have a word with him now,' M. Kahn
whispered into M. Béjuin's ear.</p>

<p>But as he was rising from his seat, the President, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
during the last few moments had been looking round to see if
all the deputies were in their places, rang his bell authoritatively.
Then all at once there was profound silence. A
fair-haired member in the first row of seats now stood up,
holding a large sheet of paper upon which he kept his eyes
fixed as he spoke.</p>

<p>'I have the honour,' he said in a sing-song voice, 'to
present a report upon the bill by which it is proposed to include
among the estimates of the Ministry of State for 1856 a sum
of 400,000 francs, to defray the expenses of the ceremonies
and rejoicings connected with the baptism of the Prince
Imperial.'</p>

<p>Then he slowly stepped forward as though about to lay
the paper on the table of the Chamber, but the deputies cried
out unanimously: 'Read it! Read it!'</p>

<p>The deputy who had prepared the report waited till the
President gave his sanction. Then he commenced in a voice
that seemed affected by emotion: 'Gentlemen, the bill which
has been brought before us is one of those which make the
customary formalities of voting seem dilatory, since they
check the enthusiastic impulses of the Corps Législatif.'</p>

<p>'Hear! hear!' cried several members.</p>

<p>'In the humblest families,' continued the speaker in carefully
modulated tones, 'the birth of a son and heir, with all
the ideas of transmission which are attached to that title, is a
source of such sweet joy that the trials of the past are forgotten,
and hope alone hovers over the cradle of the new-born child.
What, then, shall we say of such a happy event when it not
only prompts the rejoicing of a family but that of a great
nation, and is an event of European interest?'</p>

<p>This piece of rhetoric thrilled the Chamber with emotion.
Rougon, who appeared to be asleep, could see none but
beaming faces in front of him. Some deputies accentuated
their attention, holding their hands to their ears so that
they might lose nothing of this carefully prepared report.
Its author, after a slight pause, raised his voice as he continued,
'To-day, gentlemen, it is indeed the great family of
France that invites all its members to give expression to their
joy; and what pomp and circumstance would be magnificent
enough if it were possible by display to express the grandeur
of our legitimate hopes?' Here the reporter paused again.</p>

<p>'Hear! hear!' cried the deputies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>'That's very nicely put,' M. Kahn remarked; 'isn't it,
Béjuin?'</p>

<p>M. Béjuin was wagging his head with his eyes fixed on
the cut-glass chandelier which hung from the window-ceiling
in front of the President's seat. He was in a state of blissful
rapture.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the gallery the fair Clorinde kept her opera-glass
to her eyes and lost not a single expression of the
reporter's face. The Charbonnels' eyes were moist, and
Madame Correur had assumed a decorously attentive attitude,
while the colonel expressed his approbation by nodding his
head, and pretty Madame Bouchard ventured to lean against
M. d'Escorailles' knees. The President and the clerk and
the ushers listened solemnly, without making the slightest
gesture.</p>

<p>'The cradle of the Prince Imperial,' resumed the reporter,
'is henceforth our security for the future; for, by perpetuating
the dynasty which we have all acclaimed, it assures the prosperity
of our country, its repose and stability, and, through
ours, that of the rest of Europe.'</p>

<p>Cries of 'Hush! hush!' were necessary to subdue the burst
of enthusiastic applause which broke out at this touching
reference to the cradle.</p>

<p>'Once before a scion of this illustrious race seemed equally
intended for a great destiny, but his time and our own have
no similarity. Peace is the result of the wise and skilful rule
of which we are now reaping the fruits, even as the genius of
war dictated that epic poem which forms the story of the first
Empire.</p>

<p>'Hailed at his birth by the guns which from north to south
proclaimed the successes of our arms, the King of Rome was
not even permitted to serve his country; so, indeed, Providence
then decreed——'</p>

<p>'What's that he's saying? He's putting his foot in it,'
said sceptical M. La Rouquette. 'That's very clumsy; he'll
spoil his speech.'</p>

<p>The deputies certainly seemed uneasy. Why was this historical
reference dragged in to damp their enthusiasm? Several
of them blew their noses. The author of the report, however,
only smiled when he saw the chilling effect of his last sentences.
He raised his voice and pursued his antithesis, carefully modulating
his tones, evidently quite confident that he would make
his point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>'But, coming to us at one of those momentous times when
the birth of a single life may be regarded as the salvation of
all, the Child of France to-day gives to us and to all future
generations the right and the privilege of living and dying at
our ancestral firesides. Such is the promise vouchsafed to us
by the divine kindness.'</p>

<p>This seemed exquisite. Everybody understood, and a
murmur of pleasure travelled through the Chamber. The
assurance of an everlasting peace was very charming. The
tranquillised members once more resumed the pleased expressions
of men revelling in rhetoric. There was nothing to
disturb them. Europe belonged to their master.</p>

<p>'The Emperor,' continued the speaker with fresh vigour,
'having become the arbiter of Europe, was about to sign that
noble peace which, bringing together the productive forces of
the different nations, is as much an alliance of peoples as of
monarchs,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> when God was pleased to crown his happiness
as well as his glory. Is it not allowable to think that, at that
moment, he foresaw many fair and prosperous years while
gazing upon that cradle where slumbers, though now but an
infant, the heir who is destined to carry on his great policy?'</p>

<p>This, too, was thought very pretty. Such a hope might be
justifiably entertained, so the deputies said, as they nodded
their heads approvingly. The report, however, was now
beginning to seem a trifle long, and several members looked
solemn again. Some of them even glanced at the gallery like
practical matter-of-fact politicians who felt rather ashamed of
being thus seen spending their time in an unbusiness-like way.
Others ceased to pay attention, and reverted to their own
affairs, or again tapped the mahogany of their desks with their
finger-tips; while through the minds of others there flitted
vague recollections of other sittings when professions of devotion
had been lavished on some other cradle.</p>

<p>As for M. La Rouquette, he turned very frequently to look
at the clock, and when the hand pointed to a quarter to three
an expression of desperation passed over his face. He would
miss an appointment! Meantime M. Kahn and M. Béjuin sat
motionless side by side, with crossed arms and blinking eyes,
which wandered from the great velvet panels to the bas-relief of
white marble across which the President's frock-coat stretched
like a black bar. In the diplomatists' gallery the fair Clorinde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
was still gazing through her opera-glass, making a lengthy
examination of Rougon, who preserved the majestic mien of a
sleeping bull.</p>

<p>However, the author of the report showed no signs of
hurry, but listened to himself as he read on, indulging the
while in a rhythmic beatifical motion of the shoulders.</p>

<p>'Let us then display full and complete confidence, and
may the Corps Législatif, upon this great and solemn occasion,
bear in mind that the Emperor and itself have a common
origin, which almost confers upon it a family-right above
that which the other State bodies may possess to share in its
Sovereign's joy.</p>

<p>'The Corps Législatif, which, like himself, is the offspring
of the willing vote of the people, becomes now the mouthpiece
of the nation in offering to the august child the homage
of its unchangeable respect, of its devotion which nothing
can destroy, and of that boundless love which converts
political faith into a religion whose duties are blessed.'</p>

<p>The mention of homage and religion and duties seemed
to betoken that the speaker was drawing to a conclusion.
The Charbonnels therefore ventured to exchange remarks in
low tones, and Madame Correur stifled a slight cough in her
handkerchief; while Madame Bouchard quietly returned to
the rear of the Council of State gallery, and resumed her
seat near M. Jules d'Escorailles.</p>

<p>And, indeed, the reporter suddenly changed his tone and
came down from the solemn to the familiar, as he quickly
gabbled out: 'We propose to you, gentlemen, the adoption of
the bill, such as it has been brought forward by the Council
of State.'</p>

<p>Then he resumed his seat amidst general applause.
Shouts of 'Hear, hear!' rang out from all sides. M. de
Combelot, whose smiling attention had not waned for an
instant, even cried, 'Long live the Emperor!' but the
exclamation was lost amid the hubbub; however, Colonel
Jobelin received almost an ovation as he stood at the edge of
the gallery, and clapped his withered hands, in spite of the
regulations to the contrary. Everybody enthusiastically
congratulated everybody else. Work was over, and from row
to row kindly remarks were exchanged, while a crowd of
friends thronged round the author of the report and energetically
shook both his hands.</p>

<p>But above the confusion came a cry of 'Deliberate!
deliberate!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The President had been standing at his desk, apparently
expecting this cry. He rang his bell, and as the Chamber
suddenly became respectfully attentive, he said: 'Gentlemen,
a large number of members desire that we should at once
deliberate upon this measure.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' cried the Chamber with one voice.</p>

<p>But there was no deliberation. They proceeded to vote at
once. The two clauses of the measure which were successively
put to the Chamber were immediately passed by the
deputies rising in their places. The President had scarcely
finished reading each clause before all the members rose in a
mass with much stamping of feet, as though under the influence
of some thrill of enthusiasm. Then the urn-shaped
ballot-boxes were passed round by the ushers who, threading
their way between the seats, received the votes in these
zinc receptacles. The 400,000 francs were voted unanimously
by the 239 members present.</p>

<p>'That's good work done,' said M. Béjuin naïvely, and he
began to laugh as though he had said something witty.</p>

<p>'It's past three o'clock; I'm off,' exclaimed M. La
Rouquette, passing in front of M. Kahn.</p>

<p>The Chamber was emptying. The deputies were all making
for the doors and seemed to vanish through the walls. The
next business consisted of matters of mere local interest, and
there was soon no one left on the benches except a few willing
deputies who had probably nothing to do elsewhere, and these
resumed either their interrupted naps or their conversation at
the point where it had been broken off, the sitting concluding,
as it had begun, in the midst of listless indifference.
Gradually, too, the general buzzing subsided as though the
Corps Législatif had dropped off to sleep in some quiet corner
of Paris.</p>

<p>'You had better try to get a word with Delestang as you
go away,' said M. Kahn to M. Béjuin. 'He came with Rougon,
and must know something.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you are right; that's Delestang yonder,' replied
M. Béjuin, gazing at the councillor who was sitting on
Rougon's left; 'I never know them in those confounded
uniforms.'</p>

<p>'I shall stop here so as to have a chance of getting hold
of the great man,' added M. Kahn. 'It's necessary that we
should know the truth.'</p>

<p>The President was putting to the vote an interminable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
string of bills, which were passed by the members rising
in their places. They all stood up and then sat down
again quite mechanically, without ceasing to converse and
even without ceasing to sleep. The proceedings were
becoming so wearisome that most of the spectators whom
curiosity had brought to the gallery took their departure.
Only Rougon's friends remained. They were still hoping that
he would speak.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a deputy, whose correctly trimmed whiskers
bespoke the provincial lawyer, arose. This at once stopped
the monotonous mechanism of the voting. Surprise made all
the members turn and look at the one who had risen.
'Gentlemen,' said he, standing in his place, 'I ask permission
to explain the reasons which, to my great regret, have compelled
me to differ from the majority of the Committee.'</p>

<p>His voice was so shrill and comical that the fair Clorinde
had to stifle a laugh with her hands. Below in the Chamber
itself, the astonishment was increasing. What was the man
talking about? By dint of inquiries, the others ascertained
that the President had just brought before the Chamber a bill
authorising the department of the Pyrénées-Orientales to
borrow 250,000 francs wherewith to build a Palace of Justice
at Perpignan. The speaker, who was a general councillor of
the department, was opposing the bill. The matter seemed
likely to be interesting, so the deputies began to listen.</p>

<p>The member with the correctly trimmed whiskers spoke,
however, with great circumspection. He used the most
guarded language, and referred with the greatest respect to all
the authorities; but the expenses of the department, he said,
were very heavy, and he dwelt at length upon the financial
situation of the Pyrénées-Orientales. Moreover, he did not
think that any necessity for a new Palace of Justice had been
satisfactorily demonstrated. He continued in this strain for
a quarter of an hour, and on sitting down seemed quite overcome
with emotion. Then Rougon again slowly dropped his
eyelids which he had temporarily raised.</p>

<p>However, the reporter of the Committee which had examined
the bill got up. He was a little animated old man who
spoke in clear, incisive tones like one who is sure of his
ground. He began with a complimentary reference to his
honourable colleague, with whom he regretted to find himself
in disagreement. But really, he went on to say, the department
of the Pyrénées-Orientales was not nearly so heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
burdened as had been alleged, and he brought forward fresh
figures which showed the financial position of the department
in an entirely different light. Moreover, the absolute necessity
for a new Palace of Justice could not be denied. And he
entered into details. The old Palace, he said, was situated in
such a densely populated neighbourhood that the noise of the
streets prevented the judges from hearing counsel speak.
Then it was too small; and when the Assizes were being held,
and there happened to be a large number of witnesses in
attendance, they were obliged to remain on the landings
exposed to the solicitations of interested parties who might
desire to influence them. The speaker concluded by mentioning
as an irresistible argument the fact that the measure had
been introduced at the instigation of the Keeper of the Seals
himself.</p>

<p>Rougon was sitting quite still, his hands clasped upon his
legs and his head resting against the mahogany desk. At the
outset of the discussion his shoulders had seemed to sink
lower than before, but when the first speaker rose to reply, he
raised his big frame without actually getting on to his feet, and
said in a husky voice: 'The honourable member who reported
upon this measure forgot to mention that it has also received
the approval of the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of
Finance.'</p>

<p>Then he let himself drop again and resumed the attitude
of a drowsy bull. A slight murmur ran through the Chamber,
and the deputy who had risen to reply sat down with a low
bow. The bill was passed, and those members who had
shown any interest in the debate once more assumed an expression
of indifference.</p>

<p>Rougon had spoken. From one section of the gallery to
another Colonel Jobelin exchanged glances with the Charbonnels,
while Madame Correur made ready to leave her place,
just as she would have quitted her box at the theatre before
the fall of the curtain, if the hero of the play had delivered
his last speech. M. d'Escorailles and Madame Bouchard had
already taken their departure. Clorinde stood by the velvet-covered
balustrade, her majestic figure showing conspicuously
as she slowly wrapped her lace shawl about her, glancing
round the deputies' seats as she did so. The rain was no
longer beating down upon the window, but the sky remained
overcast. The mahogany desks looked quite black in that
sombre light, and a shadowy mist streamed over the seats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
which the bald heads of some of the deputies lighted up here
and there with patches of white. Against the marble-work
below the vague, pale allegorical figures, the President and the
clerks and ushers, all in black and ranged in a line, showed
like the stiff silhouettes of a shadow-pantomime. The whole
Chamber became blurred in the suddenly waning light.</p>

<p>'Oh, come along!' exclaimed Clorinde, pushing her
mother out of the gallery; 'it is enough to kill one in here!'</p>

<p>She quite startled the drowsy ushers in the corridor by
the strange fashion in which she had twisted her shawl round
her hips.</p>

<p>When they got downstairs into the hall the ladies met
Colonel Jobelin and Madame Correur.</p>

<p>'We are waiting for him here,' said the colonel. 'Perhaps
he will come out this way. But in any case I have signalled
to Kahn and Béjuin to come and give me some information.'</p>

<p>Madame Correur stepped up to the Countess Balbi. 'Ah!
it would be a great misfortune,' she said in a disconsolate
voice without attempting to explain her meaning.</p>

<p>The colonel raised his eyes to heaven. 'The country has
need of men like Rougon,' he resumed after a short pause.
'The Emperor would make a great mistake.'</p>

<p>Then there was another pause. Clorinde tried to peep into
the 'Salle des Pas Perdus,' but an usher promptly closed the
door. So she came back to her mother, who was standing
silent in her black veil. 'What a bore it is having to wait like
this!' she muttered.</p>

<p>Some soldiers now made their appearance, and Colonel
Jobelin thereupon announced that the sitting was over. Next
the Charbonnels came into sight at the top of the staircase,
and made their way down very carefully one after the other
and each clinging to the balustrade. As soon as M. Charbonnel
saw the colonel he called out: 'He didn't say much, but he completely
shut them up.'</p>

<p>'He hadn't a proper chance,' the colonel whispered when
the other reached him, 'otherwise you would have heard
something fine. He wants warming up.'</p>

<p>However, the soldiers had formed a double line from the
Chamber to the gallery leading to the President's mansion.
Then a procession made its appearance while the drummers
beat a salute. At the head walked two ushers, dressed in
black with cocked hats under their arms, chains about their
necks, and swords with steel hilts at their sides. Then came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the President, escorted by two officers. The clerks of the
Chamber and the President's secretary followed. As the
President passed the fair Clorinde he smiled at her like
a <i>homme du monde</i>, notwithstanding the pomp of his procession.</p>

<p>'Ah, you are there!' cried M. Kahn, running up with
a distracted look.</p>

<p>Though the public were at that time excluded from the
'Salle des Pas Perdus,' he took them all into it and conducted
them to one of the large glass doors which opened upon the
garden. He seemed very much annoyed. 'I have missed
him again!' he cried. 'He slipped out into the Rue de
Bourgogne while I was waiting for him in the Général Foy
gallery. But it really makes no difference; we shall get to
know everything all the same. I have sent Béjuin after
Delestang.'</p>

<p>They waited for another ten long minutes. The deputies
were all coming away looking careless and unconcerned.
Some of them lingered to light cigars and others stood in little
groups, laughing and shaking hands. Madame Correur had
stepped aside to inspect the 'Laocoon'; and while the
Charbonnels threw back their heads to look at a sea-gull which
a whimsical artist had painted on the frame of a fresco, as
though it were flying out of the picture, the fair Clorinde,
standing in front of the great bronze figure of Minerva,
examined the arms and bosom of the gigantic goddess with
an air of interest. Meantime in a corner by the glass door
Colonel Jobelin and M. Kahn were carrying on an animated
conversation in low tones.</p>

<p>'Ah, there's Béjuin!' suddenly exclaimed the latter.
Then they all drew together with an expression of anxiety.
M. Béjuin was breathing heavily. 'Well?' they asked him.</p>

<p>'Well! the resignation has been accepted, and Rougon
retires.'</p>

<p>It was a crushing blow. An interval of deep silence
followed. However, Clorinde, who, to employ her nervous
fingers, was knotting a corner of her shawl, caught sight of pretty
Madame Bouchard walking slowly along the garden, upon M.
d'Escorailles' arm, with her head inclined over his shoulder.
They had come down before the others, and, taking advantage of
an open door, were now strolling like lovers under the lacework
of fresh young leaves, in the quiet walks usually utilised
for serious meditation. Clorinde beckoned to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>'The great man has retired!' she said to the smiling
young woman.</p>

<p>At this Madame Bouchard abruptly dropped her cavalier's
arm, and turned very pale and grave, while M. Kahn,
surrounded by Rougon's alarmed friends, despairingly raised
his arms to heaven, unable to say a single word.</p>



<hr class="chap">
<h3><a name="II" id="II">II</a></h3>

<h3>RESIGNATION</h3>


<p>In the next morning's <i>Moniteur</i> Rougon's resignation was
officially announced. It was stated that he had resigned for
'reasons of health.' After his lunch, wishing to set everything
in order for his successor, he went down to the Council
of State, and installed himself in the spacious room hung with
crimson and gold, which was assigned to the President. And
there, in front of a large rosewood writing-table, he began to
empty the drawers and classify the papers, which he tied up
in bundles with pieces of pink tape. All at once, however, he
rang the bell, and an usher entered the room—a splendidly
built man who had served in the cavalry.</p>

<p>'Give me a lighted candle,' said Rougon.</p>

<p>Then as the usher was leaving the room, after placing on
the table a small candlestick taken from the mantelpiece,
Rougon called him back. 'Admit nobody, Merle,' he said;
'no one at all, you understand?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Monsieur le Président,' replied the usher, closing the
door noiselessly behind him.</p>

<p>A faint smile played over Rougon's face. He turned
towards Delestang, who stood at the other end of the room
carefully examining the contents of several pasteboard boxes.
'Our friend Merle hasn't read the <i>Moniteur</i> this morning,'
he muttered.</p>

<p>Delestang merely shook his head, unable to think of any
suitable reply. He had a magnificent head, very bald,
indeed, but bald after that precocious fashion which is rather
pleasing to women. His bare skull greatly increased the size
of his brow and gave him an expression of vast intelligence.
His clean-shaven, florid, and somewhat squarely cut face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
recalled those perfect, pensive countenances which imaginative
painters are wont to confer upon great statesmen.</p>

<p>'Merle is extremely devoted to you,' he remarked after a
pause.</p>

<p>Then he lowered his head over the pasteboard box which
he was examining, while Rougon crumpled up a handful of
papers, and after lighting them at the taper threw them into a
large bronze vase which stood at the edge of his table. He
watched them burn away.</p>

<p>'Don't touch the boxes at the bottom, Delestang,' he said;
'there are papers in them that I must examine myself.'</p>

<p>Then, for another quarter of an hour, they both went on
with their respective occupations in silence. It was a very
fine day, and the sun streamed in through three large windows
which overlooked the quay. Through one of them, which
was half open, puffs of fresh air from the Seine were wafted
in, occasionally stirring the fringe of the silk curtains, and
rustling the crumpled pieces of paper which lay about the
floor.</p>

<p>'Just look at this,' said Delestang, handing Rougon a
letter which he had found.</p>

<p>Rougon read it and then quietly lighted it at the taper.
It was a letter on a delicate matter. The two men carried on
a disjointed conversation, breaking off every few moments to
bury their faces afresh in the piles of old papers. Rougon
thanked Delestang for having come to help him. He was the
only person whom he felt that he could trust to assist him in
this task of washing the dirty linen of his five years' presidency.
They had been friends together in the Legislative
Assembly, where they had sat side by side on the same bench.
It was there that Rougon had taken a genuine fancy to this
splendid-looking man, on finding that he was so delightfully
foolish and shallow and proud. He often used to say with an
air of conviction that 'that precious Delestang would go a
long way.' He did what he could to push him on, gratitude
yielding devotion, and he made use of him as a kind of strong
box in which he locked up whatever he could not carry about
with him.</p>

<p>'How foolish of me to have kept all these papers!'
Rougon murmured, as he opened a fresh drawer which was
crammed quite full.</p>

<p>'Here is a letter from a lady!' said Delestang winking.</p>

<p>At this Rougon broke out into a loud laugh, and his huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
chest shook. He took the letter with a protest. However, as
soon as his eyes had glanced over the first lines, he exclaimed:
'It was little Escorailles who let this drop here! They are
pretty things those letters. With three lines from a woman,
a fellow may go a long way!' Then, as he burnt the letter,
he added: 'Be on your guard against women, Delestang!'</p>

<p>Delestang bent his head again. He was perpetually
becoming the victim of some hazardous passion. In 1851 he
had all but ruined his political prospects. At that time he
had been madly infatuated with the wife of a socialist deputy,
and to curry favour with her husband had more frequently
than not voted with the opposition against the Élysée. The
<i>coup d'état</i> of the second of December consequently filled him
with terrible alarm, and he shut himself up for a couple of
days in distraction, overwhelmed, good for nothing, trembling
with fear lest he should be arrested. However, Rougon had
helped him out of his awkward position, advising him not to
stand at the ensuing elections and taking him down to the
Élysée, where he succeeded in getting him a place in the
Council of State. Delestang, whose father had been a wine-merchant
at Bercy, was himself a retired attorney and the
owner of a model farm near Sainte-Menehould. He was
worth several millions of francs and lived in a very handsome
house in the Rue du Colisée.</p>

<p>'Yes, beware of women,' Rougon repeated, pausing after
each word so as to glance at his papers. 'When a woman
does not put a crown on your head she slips a halter round
your neck. At our age a man's heart wants as carefully
looking after as his stomach.'</p>

<p>At this moment a loud noise was heard in the ante-chamber,
and Merle's voice could be recognised refusing
admission to some visitor. However, a little man suddenly
rushed into the room, exclaiming, 'I really must shake
hands with my dear friend!'</p>

<p>'Hallo! is it you, Du Poizat?' exclaimed Rougon without
rising.</p>

<p>Merle was making sweeping gesticulations to excuse himself,
but his master bade him close the door. Then he
quietly said to Du Poizat: 'I thought you were at Bressuire.
So you desert your sub-prefecture as easily as an old mistress,
eh?'</p>

<p>Du Poizat, who was a slightly built man with a mean-looking
face and very white irregular teeth, shrugged his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
shoulders as he replied: 'I arrived in Paris this morning on
business, and I did not intend to come and see you till the
evening, when I should have called upon you in the Rue
Marbeuf and have asked you to give me some dinner. But
when I read the <i>Moniteur</i>——' Then he broke off, pulled an
easy-chair in front of the writing-table, and seated himself
face to face with Rougon. 'Well now, what's been happening,
eh?' he resumed. 'I've come from the depths of the
Deux-Sèvres. I had heard something down there, but I had
no idea of this. Why didn't you write to me?'</p>

<p>Rougon, in his turn, shrugged his shoulders. It was
evident that tidings of his disgrace had reached Du Poizat in
the country, and that he had hastened to Paris to see if he
could find a means of securing stability for his own position.
So Rougon gave him a keen glance as he rejoined: 'I should
have written to you this evening. Send in your resignation,
my good fellow.'</p>

<p>'That's all that I wanted to know. Well, I will resign,'
replied Du Poizat quietly.</p>

<p>Then he rose from his seat and began to whistle. As he
slowly paced the room he caught sight of Delestang kneeling
on the carpet in the midst of a litter of pasteboard boxes. He
approached and silently shook hands with him. Then he
took a cigar out of his pocket and lighted it at the candle.</p>

<p>'I may smoke here, I suppose, as you are moving?' he
said, again sitting down in the easy-chair. 'It's good fun is
moving!'</p>

<p>Rougon, however, was absorbed in a bundle of papers
which he read with deep attention, sorting them very carefully,
burning some and preserving others. Du Poizat, with
his head lolling back, and puffing light clouds of smoke from
between his lips, remained watching him. They had become
acquainted with each other some months before the Revolution
of February, 1848. At that time they were both
boarding with Madame Correur at the Hôtel Vanneau in the
Rue Vanneau. Du Poizat had found himself quite at home
there, for he and Madame Correur had both been born at
Coulonges, a little town in the district of Niort. His father,
a process-server, had sent him to study law in Paris, where
he allowed him only a hundred francs a month, although he
had amassed large sums by lending money for short periods
at extortionate interest. The old man's wealth seemed, indeed,
so inexplicably great to his country neighbours that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
was said he had discovered a large treasure in an old chest of
drawers upon which he had distrained. From the outset of
the Bonapartist propaganda Rougon had availed himself of
the services of this scraggy youth, who, chafing and fuming,
made such short work of his monthly hundred francs, and
they dabbled together in the most risky undertakings. Later
on, when Rougon was desirous of entering the Legislative
Assembly, Du Poizat worked energetically to secure his election
for Deux-Sèvres. Then, after the <i>coup d'état</i>, Rougon
in his turn used all his influence on behalf of Du Poizat and
got him appointed sub-prefect at Bressuire. The young man,
then barely thirty years of age, had desired to return in
triumph to his own neighbourhood, where he would be near
his father, through whose avarice he had led a life of torture
ever since leaving college.</p>

<p>'And how is your father?' asked Rougon, without raising
his eyes.</p>

<p>'Oh, much too well,' answered Du Poizat bluntly. 'He
has sent his last remaining servant away because she ate
three pounds of bread a week. Now he keeps a couple of
loaded guns behind his door, and when I go to see him I have
to parley with him over the wall of the yard.'</p>

<p>While talking, Du Poizat leaned forward and poked his
fingers into the bronze vase, where some fragments of paper
were lying only half-consumed. Rougon sharply raised his
head as he noticed this. He had always felt somewhat distrustful
of his old lieutenant, whose irregular white teeth
resembled those of a young wolf. In the days when they had
worked together he had always made a point of never allowing
any compromising document to fall into his hands; and now,
as he saw him trying to decipher some words that still remained
legible on the charred fragments, he threw a handful
of blazing letters into the vase. Du Poizat perfectly understood
why he did so; however, he merely smiled and began
to joke. 'It's a thorough cleaning you're going in for,' he
said.</p>

<p>Then he took a large pair of scissors and began to use
them as tongs. He raised the letters which were not consumed
to the taper in order to relight them, held up those
which had been too tightly crumpled to burn in the vase, and
stirred all the flaming ashes as though he were mixing a
blazing bowl of punch. The red-hot sparks danced about in
the vase, and a cloud of bluish smoke arose and gently curled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
away towards the open window. At intervals the candle
flickered and then burnt brightly again with a straight, tall
flame.</p>

<p>'That candle looks like a funeral-taper!' said Du Poizat
with a grin. 'Ah! it's really a burial, my poor friend.
What a lot of skeletons that require to be reduced to ashes,
eh!'</p>

<p>Rougon was about to reply, when a fresh commotion was
heard in the ante-chamber. Merle was a second time refusing
admission. As the voices grew louder, Rougon at last exclaimed:
'Will you kindly see what it is, Delestang? If I
show myself we shall be quite invaded.'</p>

<p>Delestang cautiously opened the door and closed it behind
him. But he popped his head into the room almost immediately
afterwards, exclaiming: 'It's Kahn!'</p>

<p>'Oh, well!' replied Rougon; 'let him come in; but no
one else, mind!' Then he called to Merle and reiterated his
orders.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon, my dear friend,' he said, turning to
Kahn, as soon as the usher had left the room; 'but I am so
very busy. Sit down beside Du Poizat and keep quite still or
I shall be obliged to turn you both out of the room.'</p>

<p>The deputy did not appear in the least offended by
Rougon's blunt reception. He was quite accustomed to those
ways. He took an easy-chair and sat down beside Du Poizat,
who was lighting a second cigar. 'It is getting very warm,'
he said, after drawing breath. 'I have just been to the Rue
Marbeuf; I expected to find you at home.'</p>

<p>Rougon made no reply, and there was an interval of
silence. The ex-President crumpled up some papers and
threw them into a basket which he had placed by his side.</p>

<p>'I want to talk to you,' resumed M. Kahn.</p>

<p>'Talk away!' said Rougon; 'I am listening.'</p>

<p>Then the deputy seemed to become suddenly aware of the
disorder of the room. 'What are you doing?' he asked with
admirably feigned surprise. 'Are you changing your room?'</p>

<p>His tone seemed so sincere that Delestang actually paused
in what he was doing in order to hand him the <i>Moniteur</i>.</p>

<p>'Oh dear! Oh dear!' he cried, as soon as he had glanced
at the paper. 'I thought the matter was satisfactorily arranged
yesterday evening. This comes upon me like a
thunderbolt. My dear friend——'</p>

<p>He rose and pressed Rougon's hands. The latter looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
at him in silence, while two deep scoffing creases appeared on
his heavy face near his under lip. As Du Poizat seemed
quite unmoved, he suspected that he and Kahn had already
met earlier in the morning, and he was confirmed in this
opinion as the deputy had shown no surprise at seeing the
sub-prefect. He surmised that one of the pair had come
straight to the Council of State while the other hastened to
the Rue Marbeuf, so that they might be sure to find him at
the one or the other place.</p>

<p>'Well, there is something you want to say to me,' quietly
resumed Rougon. 'What is it?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I won't trouble you about that now, my dear friend!'
exclaimed the deputy. 'You have got sufficient to worry you
as it is. I should be very sorry to bother you with my own
troubles at a time like this.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it will be no bother, I assure you. Speak away.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, I wanted to speak to you about that affair of
mine, that confounded grant. I am very glad that Du Poizat
is here, as he may be able to give us information upon certain
points.'</p>

<p>Then he explained at great length the exact position which
the matter had reached. It was a scheme for a railway from
Niort to Angers, upon which he had been engaged for the last
three years. The projected line would pass through Bressuire,
where he possessed some blast-furnaces, the value of which it
would largely increase. At the present time there were great
difficulties in the way of transport, and the business was consequently
languishing. M. Kahn had some hopes, too, that
he would be able to get some very profitable pickings out of
the affair, and so he had greatly exerted himself in order to
obtain the grant. Rougon had supported him energetically,
and the grant had almost been secured when M. de Marsy,
the Minister of the Interior, vexed at having no share in the
affair, which he guessed would afford a superb opportunity
for jobbery, and being also very desirous of doing anything
that might annoy Rougon, had used all his influence to oppose
the scheme. With that audacity of his which made him such
a terrible opponent, he had even just persuaded the Minister
of Public Works to offer the grant to the Western Railway
Company, besides circulating a statement that this company
alone could successfully carry out the branch line, for the
satisfactory working of which some substantial guarantee was
required. Thus M. Kahn seemed in great danger of losing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
all the advantages he had hoped to gain, and Rougon's fall
appeared likely to involve him in ruin.</p>

<p>'I heard yesterday,' said he, 'that one of the company's
engineers had been instructed to make a survey for the new
line. Have you heard anything of it, Du Poizat?'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' replied the sub-prefect. 'The survey has
already commenced. They are trying to avoid the detour
which you were planning in order to make the line touch
Bressuire, and propose to carry it straight along past Parthenay
and Thouars.'</p>

<p>A gesture of discouragement escaped the deputy. 'It is
sheer persecution!' he exclaimed. 'What harm could it
do them to let the line pass my place? But I will protest
and write against their plan. I will go back with you to
Bressuire.'</p>

<p>'No, no; you had better not wait for me,' said Du Poizat
with a smile. 'It seems that I have got to resign.'</p>

<p>M. Kahn fell back in his chair, as though overcome by a
final catastrophe. He rubbed his beard with both hands and
looked at Rougon with an air of entreaty. The latter had
ceased to examine his papers, and was leaning on his elbows
and listening.</p>

<p>'I suppose,' he said, somewhat roughly, 'that you want
my advice? Well, then, my good friends, just remain quiet
and try to keep things as they are until we get the upper
hand. Du Poizat is going to resign, because, if he didn't, he
would be dismissed within a fortnight. As for you, Kahn,
you had better write to the Emperor and use all available
means to prevent the grant being obtained by the Western
Railway Company. You won't get it for yourself at present,
but as long as it is not given to any one else, there is a
chance of your winning it later on.' Then, as the two men
nodded, he continued: 'Well, that's all I can do for you. I
am down and you must give me time to pick myself up again.
You don't see me going about with a woe-begone face, do
you? Well, I should be much obliged if you wouldn't look
as though you were attending my funeral. For my part, I
am delighted at retiring into private life again. I shall at
last be able to take a little rest.'</p>

<p>He heaved a deep sigh, crossed his arms, and rocked his
huge frame backwards and forwards. M. Kahn said nothing
more about his scheme, but tried to imitate Du Poizat and
appear perfectly indifferent. Delestang had opened some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
more pasteboard boxes, and worked away so quietly behind
the chairs that the slight rustling noise which he made every
now and then might have been attributed to a troop of mice
flitting across the papers. Meantime the sunlight was travelling
over the crimson carpet and lighting up a corner of the
writing-table, paling the flame of the candle which was still
burning there.</p>

<p>A friendly conversation sprang up amongst the men.
Rougon, who was tying up some more bundles of papers,
declared that he was really not cut out for politics, and smiled
good-naturedly as his heavy eyelids drooped, as though with
weariness, over his glistening eyes. He would have liked, he
said, to have a large estate to cultivate, fields which he could
dig up at his pleasure, and flocks of animals, horses, cattle,
sheep, and dogs, of which he would be the one absolute
monarch. He told them that in former days, when only a
country lawyer at Plassans, his great pleasure had consisted
in setting off in a blouse on a shooting expedition of several
days through the ravines of La Seille, where he shot eagles.
He said that he was a peasant; his grandfather had dug the
soil. Then he assumed the air of a man disgusted with the
world. Power had grown wearisome to him, and he meant
to spend the summer in the country. He declared that he
had never felt so light-hearted as he did that morning, and
he gave a mighty shrug of his strong shoulders as though he
had just thrown off some heavy burden.</p>

<p>'How much did you get here as President?' asked
M. Kahn; 'eighty thousand francs?'</p>

<p>Rougon nodded assent.</p>

<p>'And now you'll only have your thirty thousand as a
senator.'</p>

<p>However, Rougon exclaimed that this change would not
affect him at all. He could live upon next to nothing and
indulged in no vices; which was perfectly true. He was
neither a gambler, nor a glutton, nor a loose liver. His whole
ambition, he declared, was to be his own master. Then he
reverted to his idea of a farm, where he would be king of all
sorts of animals. His ideal life was to wield a whip and be
paramount; to be the master, chief both in intelligence and
power. Gradually he grew animated and talked of animals
as though they had been men, declaring that the mob liked
to be driven, and that shepherds directed their flocks by
pelting them with stones. His face seemed transfigured, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
thick lips protruded scornfully, while his whole expression
was instinct with strength and power. While he spoke he
brandished a bundle of papers in his clenched fist, and it
seemed every now and then as though he were going to throw
it at the heads of M. Kahn and Du Poizat, who watched his
sudden outburst of excitement with uneasy anxiety.</p>

<p>'The Emperor has behaved very badly,' at last muttered
Du Poizat.</p>

<p>Then Rougon all at once became quite calm again. His
face turned loamy and his body seemed to grow flabby and
obese. He began to sound the Emperor's praises in an
exaggerated fashion. Napoleon III. was a man of mighty
intelligence, he declared, with a mind of astonishing depth.
Du Poizat and Kahn exchanged a meaning look. But
Rougon waxed still more lavish of his praises, and, speaking
of his devotion to his master, declared with great humility
that he had always been proud of being a mere instrument
in the Emperor's hands. He talked on in this strain till he
made Du Poizat, who was of a somewhat irritable nature,
quite impatient, and they began to wrangle. The sub-prefect
spoke with considerable bitterness of all that Rougon and he
had done for the Empire between 1848 and 1851, when they
were lodging with Madame Correur in a condition of semi-starvation.
He referred to the terrible days, especially those
of the first year, when they had gone splashing through the
mud of Paris, recruiting partisans for the Emperor's cause.
Later on they had risked their skins a score of times. And
wasn't it Rougon who on the morning of the second of
December had taken possession of the Palais Bourbon at the
head of a regiment of the line? That was a game at which
men staked their lives! Yet now to-day he was being sacrificed
and made the victim of a court intrigue. Rougon,
however, protested against this assertion. He was not being
sacrificed—he was resigning for private reasons. And as
Du Poizat, now fully wound up, began to call the folks of the
Tuileries a set of 'pigs,' he ended by reducing him to silence
by bringing his fist down upon the rosewood writing-table
with a force which made it creak.</p>

<p>'That is all nonsense!' he said.</p>

<p>'You are, indeed, going rather far,' remarked M. Kahn.</p>

<p>Delestang was standing behind the chairs looking very
pale. He opened the door gently to see if any one were
listening, but there was nobody in the ante-chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
excepting Merle, whose back was turned with an appearance
of great discretion. Rougon's observation had made
Du Poizat blush, and quickly cooling down he chewed his
cigar in silent displeasure.</p>

<p>'There is no doubt that the Emperor is surrounded by
injudicious advisers,' Rougon resumed after a pause. 'I
ventured to tell him as much, and he smiled. He even condescended
to jest about it, and told me that my own <i>entourage</i>
was no better than his own.'</p>

<p>Du Poizat and Kahn laughed in a constrained fashion.
They thought the reply a very good one.</p>

<p>'But,' continued Rougon in meaning tones, 'I repeat
that I am retiring of my own free will. If any one questions
you, who are my friends, on the matter, you can say that
yesterday evening I was quite at liberty to withdraw my
resignation. You can contradict, too, the tittle-tattle which
is being circulated about Rodriguez's affair, out of which
people seem to be making a perfect romance. On this
subject no doubt I disagreed with the majority of the
Council of State, and there has certainly been a deal of
friction in the matter which has hastened my retirement.
But I had weightier and earlier reasons than that. For a
long time past I had made up my mind to resign the high
position which I owed to the Emperor's kindness.'</p>

<p>He punctuated this speech with the gesture of the right
hand, in which he constantly indulged when addressing the
Chamber. He evidently wished that what he was saying
might be made public. M. Kahn and Du Poizat, who knew
very well the kind of individual they had to deal with, tried
all kinds of stratagems to get at the real truth. They felt
quite sure that 'the great man,' as they familiarly called him
between themselves, had some formidable scheme in his
head. So they turned the conversation on general politics.
Rougon then began to scoff at the parliamentary system,
which he called 'the dunghill of mediocrity.' The Chamber,
he declared, enjoyed quite an absurd amount of liberty even
now, and indulged in far too much talk. France required
governing, he said, by a suitably devised machine, with the
Emperor at the head, and the great state-bodies, reduced to
the position of mere working gear, below. He laughed, and
his huge chest heaved, as he carried his theory to the point
of exaggeration, displaying the while a scornful contempt for
the imbeciles who demanded powerful rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>'But,' interposed M. Kahn, 'with the Emperor at the
top, and everybody else at the bottom, matters cannot be
very pleasant for any one except the Emperor.'</p>

<p>'Those who feel bored can take themselves off,' Rougon
quietly replied. He smiled, and then added: 'They can wait
till things become amusing, and then they can come back.'</p>

<p>A long interval of silence followed. M. Kahn began to
stroke his beard contentedly. He had found out what he
wanted to know. He had made a correct guess at the
Chamber on the previous afternoon when he had insinuated
that Rougon, finding his influence at the Tuileries seriously
shaken, had taken time by the forelock and resigned.
Rodriguez's business had afforded him a splendid opportunity
for honourable withdrawal.</p>

<p>'And what are people saying?' Rougon at last inquired
in order to break the silence.</p>

<p>'Well, I've only just got here,' said Du Poizat, 'but a
little while ago I heard a gentleman who wore a decoration
declaring in a café that he strongly approved of your retirement.'</p>

<p>'Béjuin was very much affected about it yesterday,'
added M. Kahn. 'Béjuin is much attached to you. He's
rather slow, but he's very genuine. Little La Rouquette,
too, spoke very properly, and referred to you in the kindest
terms.'</p>

<p>Other names were mentioned as the conversation continued.
Rougon asked direct questions, without showing the
least embarrassment, and extracted full particulars from the
deputy, who complaisantly gave him an exact account of the
demeanour of the Corps Législatif towards him.</p>

<p>'This afternoon,' interrupted Du Poizat, who felt somewhat
annoyed at having no information to impart, 'I will
take a ramble through Paris, and to-morrow morning, as
soon as I'm out of bed, I will come and tell you all I have
heard.'</p>

<p>'By the way,' cried M. Kahn, with a laugh, 'I forgot to
tell you about Combelot. I never saw a man in greater
embarrassment.'</p>

<p>He stopped short on seeing Rougon glance warningly
towards Delestang, who, with his back turned towards them,
was at that moment standing on a chair removing an accumulation
of newspapers which had been stored away atop of
a bookcase. M. de Combelot had married one of Delestang's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
sisters. Delestang himself, since Rougon had fallen into
disfavour, had felt a little down-hearted on account of his
relationship with a chamberlain; and so, wishing to affect
independence, he turned and said with a smile: 'Why don't
you go on? Combelot is an ass. That's the long and short
of it, eh?'</p>

<p>This ready condemnation of his brother-in-law afforded
the others much amusement, and Delestang, noticing his
success, continued his attack even to the extent of falling foul
of Combelot's beard, that famous black beard which had such
a reputation among the ladies. Then, as he threw a bundle
of newspapers on to the floor, he said abruptly: 'What is a
source of sorrow to some is a source of joy to others.'</p>

<p>This truism led to M. de Marsy's name being introduced
into the conversation. Rougon bent his head and devoted
himself to a searching examination of a portfolio, leaving his
friends to ease their minds. They spoke of Marsy with all
the rageful hostility which politicians show for an adversary.
They revelled in the strongest language, bringing all kinds of
abominable accusations against him, and so grossly exaggerating
such stories which had a foundation of truth that they
became mere lies. Du Poizat, who had known Marsy in
former days, before the Empire, declared that he was kept at
that time by a baroness whose diamonds he had exhausted in
three months. M. Kahn asserted that there was not a single
shady affair started in any part of Paris without Marsy having
a hand in it. They encouraged each other in charges of this
kind, and went on from worse to worse. In a mining affair
Marsy had received a bribe of fifteen hundred thousand
francs; during the previous month he had offered a furnished
house to little Florence of the Bouffes Theatre, a trifle for
which he had paid six hundred thousand francs, his share of
the profits of a speculation in Morocco railway stock; finally,
not a week ago, a grand scheme for constructing canals in
Egypt, which had been got up by certain tools of his, had
scandalously collapsed, the shareholders discovering that not
a single shovelful of earth had been turned, although they
had been paying out money for a couple of years or so. Then,
too, they fell foul of Marsy's physical appearance, tried to
depreciate his good looks, and even attacked the collection of
pictures which he was getting together.</p>

<p>'He's a brigand in the skin of a vaudevillist,' Du Poizat
ended by exclaiming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>Rougon slowly raised his head and fixed his big eyes on
the two men. 'You are going it well,' he said. 'Marsy
manages his affairs in his own way, as you manage yours in
your way. As regards myself and him, we don't get on well
together, and if ever I have a chance to crush him I shall
avail myself of it without hesitation. But all that you have
been saying doesn't prevent Marsy from being a very clever
fellow, and, if ever the whim takes him, he will only make a
mouthful of you two, I warn you of it.'</p>

<p>Then Rougon, tired of sitting, rose and stretched himself.
He gave a great yawn, as he added: 'And he will do it all the
more easily, my friends, now that I shall no longer be in a
position to interfere.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you can lead Marsy a pretty dance if you like,' said
Du Poizat, with a faint smile. 'You have some papers here
which he would be glad to pay a big price for. Those yonder,
I mean, the papers in the Lardenois matter, in which he
played such a singular part. There's a very curious letter
from him among them, which I recognise as one that I
brought you myself at the time.'</p>

<p>Rougon went up to the grate in order to throw the papers
with which he had gradually filled his basket into the fire.
The bronze vase was no longer large enough. 'We must deal
a stunning blow, and not give a mere scratch,' he replied,
shrugging his shoulders disdainfully. 'Every one has foolish
letters astray in the possession of other people.'</p>

<p>He then lighted the letter just spoken of at the candle,
and used it to set fire to the heap of papers in the grate. He
remained squatting for a moment, whilst watching the blazing
pile. Some thick official documents turned black, and
twisted about like sheets of lead; the letters and memoranda,
scrawled over with handwriting, threw up little tongues of
bluish flame, while inside the grate, amidst a swarm of
sparks, half-consumed fragments still remained quite legible.</p>

<p>At this moment the door was thrown wide open, and a
laughing voice was heard exclaiming: 'All right! I will
excuse you, Merle. I belong to the house, and if you don't
let me come in this way, I shall go round by the Council
Chamber.'</p>

<p>It was M. d'Escorailles, for whom some six months previously
Rougon had obtained an appointment as auditor at
the Council of State. On his arm hung pretty Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Bouchard, looking delightfully fresh in a bright spring
toilette.</p>

<p>'Good heavens!' muttered Rougon, 'we've got women
here now.'</p>

<p>He did not immediately leave his place by the grate, but
still stooping, grasping the shovel, and pressing down the
blazing papers so as to guard against an accident, he raised
his big face with an air of displeasure. M. d'Escorailles,
however, appeared in no way disconcerted. When he and the
young woman had crossed the threshold, they ceased to smile,
and assumed an expression more suited to the circumstances.</p>

<p>'My dear master,' said Escorailles, 'I bring a friend of
yours, who insists upon coming to express her sorrow. We
have seen the <i>Moniteur</i> this morning——'</p>

<p>'Oh, you have seen the <i>Moniteur</i>, too,' muttered Rougon,
at last rising erect. Then he caught sight of some one whom
he had not previously noticed. 'Ah, Monsieur Bouchard
also!' he exclaimed, blinking.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, the husband who, silent and dignified, had
just entered the room in the wake of his wife's skirts. M. Bouchard
was sixty years old: his hair was quite white, his eyes
were dim, and his face was worn by twenty-five years of
official labour. He did not say a single word, but took
Rougon's hand with an appearance of emotion, and gave it
three vigorous shakes.</p>

<p>'It is really very kind of you all to come and see me,' said
Rougon, 'only you will be terribly in my way. However,
come here, will you? Du Poizat, give Madame Bouchard
your chair.'</p>

<p>He turned as he spoke, and then saw Colonel Jobelin
standing in front of him. 'What! are you here as well,
colonel?' he cried.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the door had been left open, and
Merle had been unable to stop the colonel, who had come up
the staircase immediately behind the Bouchards. He was
accompanied by his son, a tall lad of fifteen, a pupil at the
Louis-le-Grand College. 'I wanted Auguste to see you,' he
said. 'It is misfortune that reveals true friends. Auguste,
go and give your hand——'</p>

<p>Rougon, however, had sprung towards the ante-room,
crying: 'Shut the door, Merle! What are you thinking
about? We shall have all Paris in here directly!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>With calm face the usher replied: 'It's all because they
caught sight of you, Monsieur le Président.'</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, he was obliged to step back close to
the wall, in order to allow the Charbonnels to pass. They
came into the room abreast, but not arm-in-arm. They were
out of breath, and looked disconsolate and amazed; and they
both began to speak at once. 'We have just seen the
<i>Moniteur</i>! What dreadful news! How distressed your
poor mother will be! And what a sad position, too, it puts
us in ourselves!'</p>

<p>More guileless than the others, the Charbonnels were
about to enter upon their own little affairs at once, but
Rougon stopped them. He shot a bolt, hidden beneath the
door lock, and remarked that if any people wanted to come in
now, they would have to break the door open. Then, observing
that none of his visitors showed signs of leaving, he
resigned himself, and tried to finish his task in the midst of
these nine people who were crowding his room. The whole
place was now in a state of chaotic confusion, there being such
a litter of portfolios and papers on the floor that when the
colonel and M. Bouchard wanted to reach a window-recess,
they had to exercise the greatest care in order to avoid
trampling upon some important document. All the chairs
were covered with bundles of papers, excepting the one on
which Madame Bouchard was now seated. She was smiling
at the gallant speeches of Du Poizat and M. Kahn; while
M. d'Escorailles, unable to find a hassock, pushed a thick blue
portfolio, stuffed with letters, under her feet. The drawers
of the writing-table, which had been pushed into a corner of
the room, afforded the Charbonnels a temporary seat where
they could recover their breath, while young Auguste,
delighted at finding himself in the bustle of a removal, poked
about till he disappeared behind the mountain of pasteboard
boxes, amid which Delestang had previously entrenched himself.
As the latter threw down the newspapers from the top
of the bookcase, he raised considerable dust, which made
Madame Bouchard cough slightly.</p>

<p>'I don't advise you to stay here amidst all this dirt,' said
Rougon, who was now emptying the boxes which he had
asked Delestang to leave unexamined.</p>

<p>The young woman, however, quite rosy from her fit of
coughing, assured him that she was very comfortable, and
that the dust would not harm her bonnet. Then all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
visitors poured forth their condolences. The Emperor, they
declared, must care very little about the real interests of the
country to allow himself to be influenced by men so unworthy
of his confidence. France was suffering a great loss. But it
was ever thus, they said; a man of high intelligence always
had every mediocrity leagued against him.</p>

<p>'Governments have no gratitude,' declared M. Kahn.</p>

<p>'So much the worse for them!' exclaimed the colonel;
'they strike themselves when they strike those who serve
them.'</p>

<p>However, M. Kahn was desirous of having the last word
on the subject, so he turned to Rougon, and said: 'When a
man like you falls, it is a subject for public mourning.'</p>

<p>This met with the approval of all. 'Yes, yes,' they
exclaimed, 'for public mourning, indeed!'</p>

<p>Rougon raised his head upon hearing this fulsome praise.
His greyish cheeks flushed slightly, and his whole face was
irradiated by a suppressed smile of satisfaction. He was as
proud of his ability as a woman is of her beauty, and he liked
to receive point-blank compliments. It was becoming evident,
however, that his visitors were in each other's way. They
repeatedly glanced at one another, resolving to sit one another
out, unwilling as they were to say all they desired in the
presence of their companions. Now that the great man had
fallen, they were anxious to know if he had done anything for
them while he yet had the power. The colonel was the first
to take an active step. He led Rougon, who, with a portfolio
under his arm, readily followed him, into one of the window-recesses.</p>

<p>'Have you given me a thought?' he asked with a
pleasant smile.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed. Your nomination as commander of the
Legion of Honour was again promised me four days ago.
But, of course, to-day it is impossible for me to say anything
with certainty. I confess to you that I am afraid my friends
will be made to suffer by my fall.'</p>

<p>The colonel's lips trembled with emotion. He stammered
that they must do what they could, and then, turning suddenly
round, he called out: 'Auguste!'</p>

<p>The lad was on his hands and knees underneath the desk,
trying to decipher the inscriptions on the batches of documents.
However, he hastened to his father.</p>

<p>'Here's this lad of mine,' resumed the colonel in an undertone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
'I shall have to find a berth for the young scamp one
of these days. I am counting upon you to help me. I
haven't made up my mind yet between the law and the public
service. Give your good friend your hand, Auguste, so that
he may recollect you.'</p>

<p>While this scene was going on, Madame Bouchard, who
had begun to bite her gloves impatiently, had risen from her
chair and made her way to the window on the left, after
giving M. d'Escorailles a look which meant that he was to
follow her. Her husband was already there, leaning upon
the cross-bar and gazing out upon the view. The leaves of
the tall chestnut trees in the Tuileries Garden were languidly
waving in the warm sunshine, and the Seine could be seen
rolling blue waters, flecked with golden light, between the
Royal and Concorde bridges.</p>

<p>Madame Bouchard suddenly turned round and exclaimed:
'Oh! Monsieur Rougon, come and look here.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Rougon hastily quitted the colonel, while Du
Poizat, who had followed the young woman, discreetly retired,
again joining M. Kahn at the middle window.</p>

<p>'Do you see that barge full of bricks? It nearly foundered
just now,' said Madame Bouchard.</p>

<p>Rougon looked and obligingly lingered there in the sunshine
till M. d'Escorailles, upon a fresh glance from the young
woman, said to him: 'Monsieur Bouchard wants to send in
his resignation. We have brought him here in order that
you may try to dissuade him.'</p>

<p>M. Bouchard then explained that he could not endure
injustice. 'Yes, Monsieur Rougon,'he continued, 'I began
as a copying-clerk in the office of the Minister of the Interior,
and reached the position of head clerk without owing either
to favour or intrigue. I have been head clerk since 1847.
Well, the post of head of department has been vacant five
times—four times under the Republic and once under the
Empire—and yet the Minister has not once thought of me,
though I had hierarchical rights to the place. Now that you
will no longer be able to fulfil the promise you gave me I
think I had better retire.'</p>

<p>Rougon tried to soothe him. The post, said he, had not
yet been bestowed upon any one else, and even if he did not
get it this time, it would only be a chance lost; a chance
which would certainly present itself again on some future
occasion. Then he grasped Madame Bouchard's hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
complimented her in a paternal fashion. Her husband's
house had been the first thrown open to him on his arrival in
Paris, and it was there that he had met the colonel, who was
the head clerk's cousin. Later on, when M. Bouchard had
inherited his father's property and had been smitten, at fifty-four
years of age, with a sudden desire to get married, Rougon
had acted as witness on behalf of Madame Bouchard, then
Adèle Desvignes, a well brought up young lady of a respectable
family at Rambouillet. The head clerk had been anxious
to marry a young lady from the provinces, because he made a
point of having a steady wife. However, the fair and adorable
little Adèle, with her innocent blue eyes, had in less than four
years proved to be a great deal worse than a mere flirt.</p>

<p>'There, now, don't distress yourself,' said Rougon, who
was still holding her hands in his big fists. 'You know very
well that I will do my best for you.'</p>

<p>Then he took M. d'Escorailles aside, and told him that he
had written that morning to his father to tranquillise him.
The young auditor must remain quietly in his place. The
Escorailles family was one of the oldest in Plassans, where it
was treated with the utmost respect; and Rougon, who in
former days had often dragged his worn-down boots past the
old Marquis's house, took a pride in protecting and assisting
the young man. The family retained an enthusiastic devotion
for Henri V., though it allowed its heir to serve the Empire.
This was one of the inevitable consequences of the wickedness
of the times.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the middle window, which they had opened
to obtain greater privacy, Kahn and Du Poizat were talking
together, while gazing out upon the distant roofs of the
Tuileries, which looked blue in the haze of the sunlight.
They were sounding each other, dropping a few words, and
then lapsing into intervals of silence. Rougon, they agreed,
was too impulsive. He ought not to have allowed himself to
be irritated by that Rodriguez question, which might have been
very easily settled. Then M. Kahn, gazing blankly into the
distance, murmured as though he were speaking to himself:
'A man knows when he falls, but never knows whether he
will rise again.'</p>

<p>Du Poizat pretended not to hear; but, after a long pause,
he said: 'Oh! he's a very clever fellow.'</p>

<p>Then the deputy abruptly turned, and, looking the sub-prefect
full in the face, spoke to him very rapidly: 'Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
ourselves, I am afraid for him. He plays with fire. We are
his friends, of course, and there can be no thought of our
abandoning him. But I must say that he has thought very
little about us in this matter. Take my own case, for
instance. I have matters of enormous importance on my
hands, and he has placed them in utter jeopardy by this
sudden freak of his. He would have no right to complain—would
he, now?—if I were to knock at somebody else's door;
for, you know, it is not I alone who suffer, there are all the
townsfolk as well.'</p>

<p>'Yes, well, go and knock at some other door,' said Du
Poizat, with a smile.</p>

<p>At this the deputy, in a sudden outburst of anger, let the
truth escape him. 'But is it possible? This confounded
fellow spoils you with everybody else. When you belong to
his band, every one else fights shy of you.'</p>

<p>Then he calmed down, sighed, and looked out towards the
Arc de Triomphe, which could be seen rising in a greyish
mass out of the green expanse of the Champs Élysées. 'Well,
well,' he continued softly, 'I'm as faithful as a dog myself.'</p>

<p>For the last moment or two the colonel had been standing
behind the two men. 'Fidelity is the road to honour,'
said he in his military voice. Then, as Du Poizat and Kahn
made room for him, he added: 'Rougon is contracting a debt
to us to-day. Rougon no longer belongs to himself.'</p>

<p>This remark met with the warmest approval. It was certainly
quite true that Rougon no longer belonged to himself.
What was more, it was necessary that he should be distinctly
told so in order that he might know what it behoved him to
do. Then the three friends chatted in whispers, forming plans
and fortifying each other with hope. At intervals they turned
and cast a glance into the big room to make sure that no one
was monopolising the great man for too long a time.</p>

<p>The great man was now gathering up the portfolios, while
still talking to Madame Bouchard. The Charbonnels were
wrangling in the corner where they had remained silent and
ill at ease ever since their arrival. They had twice attempted
to get hold of Rougon, but had been anticipated by the colonel
and the young woman. Now, at last, M. Charbonnel pushed
his wife towards the ex-President.</p>

<p>'This morning,' she stammered, 'we received a letter
from your mother——'</p>

<p>Rougon did not allow her to finish, but took her and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
husband into the window-recess on the right hand, once more
abandoning his portfolios without any great sign of impatience.</p>

<p>'We have received a letter from your mother,' repeated
Madame Charbonnel, and she was going to read the letter in
question, when Rougon took it from her and glanced over it.
Charbonnel was a retired oil merchant of Plassans, and he
and his wife had been protected by Madame Félicité, as
Rougon's mother was called in her own little town. She had
given them a letter of introduction to her son on the occasion
of their presenting a petition to the Council of State. A
cousin of theirs, one Chevassu, a lawyer at Faverolles, the
chief town of a neighbouring department, had died, leaving
his fortune of five hundred thousand francs to the Sisters
of the Holy Family. Originally the Charbonnels had not
expected to inherit his fortune, but having suddenly become
his next heirs, owing to his brother's death, they contested the
will on the ground of undue influence; and the Sisterhood
having petitioned the Council of State to authorise the payment
of the bequest to them, they had left their old home at
Plassans, hastened to Paris, and taken lodgings at the Hôtel
du Périgord in the Rue Jacob in order that they might be on
the spot to look after their interests. The matter had been
lingering on for the past six months.</p>

<p>'We are feeling extremely depressed,' sighed Madame
Charbonnel, while Rougon was reading the letter. 'I myself
was always against bringing this action, but Monsieur Charbonnel
said that with you on our side we should certainly get
the money, as you had only to say a word to put the five
hundred thousand francs into our pocket. Isn't that so,
Monsieur Charbonnel?'</p>

<p>The retired oil merchant nodded his head with a hopeless
air.</p>

<p>'And for such a sum as that,' continued Madame Charbonnel,
'it did seem worth while to make a change in our old
way of life. And it has been nicely changed and disturbed,
indeed. Will you believe it, Monsieur Rougon, they actually
refused to change our dirty towels at the hotel yesterday?
We who have five chests full of linen at home!'</p>

<p>She went on railing at Paris, which she detested. They
had originally come thither for a week. Then, as they had
always hoped to be able to return home during the following
week, they had not thought it worth while to send for anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and, their case still being unsettled, they doggedly
lingered on in their furnished lodgings, eating whatever it
pleased the cook to provide, short too of clean linen and
almost of clothes. Madame Charbonnel was obliged to dress
her hair with a broken comb. Sometimes they sat down on
their little valise and wept from very weariness and indignation.</p>

<p>'And the hotel is frequented by such queer characters!'
complained M. Charbonnel, with a shocked expression. 'A
young man has the room next to ours, and the things we
hear——'</p>

<p>But Rougon was folding up the letter. 'My mother,' said
he, 'gives you excellent advice in telling you to be patient.
I can only suggest to you to take fresh courage. You seem,
to me, to have a good case, but now that I have resigned I
dare not promise you anything.'</p>

<p>'Then we will leave Paris to-morrow!' cried Madame
Charbonnel, in an outburst of despair.</p>

<p>As soon as this cry had escaped her lips, she turned very
pale and her husband had to support her. For a moment
they both remained speechless, looking at each other with
trembling lips and feeling a great desire to burst into tears.
They felt faint and dazed as though they had just seen the
five hundred thousand francs dashed out of their hands.</p>

<p>'You have had to deal with a powerful opponent,' Rougon
continued kindly. 'Monseigneur Rochart, the Bishop of
Faverolles, has himself come to Paris to support the claim
of the Sisters of the Holy Family. If it had not been for his
intervention, you would long ago have gained your cause.
Unfortunately the clergy are now very powerful. However, I
am leaving friends here behind me, and I hope to bring some
influence to bear in your favour, while I myself keep in the
background. You have waited so long that if you go away
to-morrow——'</p>

<p>'We will remain, we will remain!' Madame Charbonnel
hastily gasped. 'Ah, Monsieur Rougon, this inheritance will
have cost us very dear!'</p>

<p>Rougon now hastened back to his papers. He cast a
glance of satisfaction round the room, delighted that there
was no one else to take him off into one of the window-recesses.
They had all had their say. And so for a few minutes he
made great progress with his task. Then he waxed bitterly
jocose and avenged himself on his visitors for the bother they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
had caused him by attacking them with biting satire. For a
quarter of an hour he proved a perfect scourge to those friends
of his to whose various stories he had just listened so obligingly.
His language and manner to pretty Madame Bouchard
became indeed so harsh and cutting that the young woman's
eyes filled with tears, though she still continued to smile. All
the others laughed, accustomed as they were to Rougon's
rough ways. They knew that their prospects were never
better than when he was belabouring them in this fashion.</p>

<p>However, all at once, there was a gentle knock at the door.
'No, no!' cried Rougon to Delestang, who was going to see
who was there; 'don't open it! Am I never to be left in
peace? My head is splitting already.' Then, as the knocking
continued with greater energy, he growled between his
teeth: 'Ah, if I were going to stay here, I would send
Merle about his business!'</p>

<p>The knocking ceased, but suddenly a little door in a corner
of the room was thrown back and gave entrance to a huge blue
silk skirt, which came in backwards. This skirt, which was
very bright and profusely ornamented with bows of ribbon,
remained stationary for a moment, half inside the room and
half outside, without anything further being visible. However,
a soft female voice was heard speaking.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Rougon!' exclaimed the lady, at last showing
her face.</p>

<p>It was Madame Correur, wearing a bonnet with a cluster
of roses on it. Rougon, who had stepped angrily towards the
door, with fists clenched, now bowed and grasped the new-comer's
hand.</p>

<p>'I was asking Merle how he liked being here,' she said,
casting a tender glance at the big lanky usher, who stood
smiling in front of her. 'And you, Monsieur Rougon, are
you satisfied with him?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, certainly,' replied Rougon pleasantly.</p>

<p>Merle's face still retained its sanctimonious smile, and he
kept his eyes fixed upon Madame Correur's plump neck. The
latter braced herself up to her full height and then brought
her curls over her forehead.</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear that, my man,' she continued. 'When
I get any one a place, I am anxious that all parties should be
satisfied. If you ever want any advice, Merle, you can come
and see me any morning, you know, between eight and nine.
Mind you keep steady, now.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she came inside the room, and said to Rougon:
'There are no servants so good as those old soldiers.'</p>

<p>And afterwards she took hold of him and made him cross
the room, leading him with short steps to the window at the
other end. There she scolded him for not having admitted
her. If Merle had not allowed her to come in by the little
door, she would still have been waiting outside. And it was
absolutely necessary that she should see him, she said, for he
really could not take himself off in that way without letting
her know how her petitions were progressing. Forthwith she
drew from her pocket a little memorandum-book, very richly
ornamented and bound in rose-coloured watered silk.</p>

<p>'I did not see the <i>Moniteur</i> till after <i>déjeuner</i>,' she
continued; 'and then I took a cab at once. Tell me, now,
how is the matter of Madame Leturc, the captain's widow,
who wants a tobacco shop, getting on? I promised her that
she should have a definite answer next week. There's also
the case of Herminie Billecoq, you remember, who used to
be a pupil of Saint Denis. Her seducer, an officer, has consented
to marry her if any charitable soul will give her
the regulation dowry. We thought about applying to the
Empress. Then there are all those ladies, Madame Chardon,
Madame Testanière, and Madame Jalaguier, who have been
waiting for months.'</p>

<p>Rougon quietly gave her the replies she sought, explained
the various causes of the delays that had occurred, and entered
into minute details. However, he gave her to understand
that she must not reckon so much upon him in the
future as she had done in the past. This threw her into
great distress. It made her so happy, she said, to be able to
be of service to any one. What would become of her with all
those ladies? Then she spoke of her own affairs, with which
Rougon was fully acquainted. She again reminded him that
she was a Martineau, one of the Martineaus of Coulonges, a
good family of La Vendée, in which fathers and sons had
been notaries without a break over seven successive generations.
She never clearly explained how she came to bear
the name of Correur. When she was twenty-four years old
she had eloped with a young journeyman butcher, and for
six months her father had suffered the greatest distress from
this disgraceful scandal, about which the neighbourhood still
gossiped. Ever since then she had been living in Paris,
utterly ignored by her family. She had written fully a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
times to her brother, who was now at the head of the family
practice, but had failed to get any reply from him. His
silence, she said, was due to her sister-in-law, a woman who
'carried on with priests, and led that imbecile brother of hers
by the nose.' One of her most cherished ambitions, as in
Du Poizat's case, was to return to her own neighbourhood as
a well-to-do and honoured woman.</p>

<p>'I wrote again a week ago,' she said; 'but I have no
doubt she throws my letters into the fire. However, if my
brother should die, she would be obliged to let me go to the
house, for they have no child, and I should have interests
to look after. My brother is fifteen years older than I am,
and I hear that he suffers from gout.' Then she suddenly
changed her tone, and continued: 'However, don't let us
bother about that now. It's for you that we must use all
our energies at present, Eugène. We will do our best, you
shall see. It is necessary that you should be everything in
order that we may be something. You remember '51, don't
you, eh?'</p>

<p>Rougon smiled, and as Madame Correur pressed his hands
with a maternal air, he bent down and whispered into her
ear: 'If you see Gilquin, tell him to be prudent. Only the
other week, when he got himself locked up, he took it into his
head to give my name, so that I might bail him out.'</p>

<p>Madame Correur promised to speak to Gilquin, one of her
tenants at the time when Rougon had lodged at the Hôtel
Vanneau, and withal a very useful fellow on certain occasions,
though apt to be extremely compromising. 'I have a
cab below, and so now I'll be off,' she said aloud with a smile
as she stepped into the middle of the room.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she lingered for a few minutes longer, hoping
that the others would take their departure at the same time.
In her desire to effect this, she offered to take one of them
with her in her cab. The colonel accepted the offer, and it
was settled that young Auguste should sit beside the driver.
Then general hand-shaking began. Rougon took up a position
by the door, which was thrown wide open; and as his
visitors passed out, each gave him a parting assurance of
sympathy. M. Kahn, Du Poizat, and the colonel stretched
out their necks and whispered a few words in his ear, begging
him not to forget them. However, when the Charbonnels
had already reached the first step of the staircase, and
Madame Correur was chatting with Merle at the far end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the ante-room, Madame Bouchard, for whom her husband
and M. d'Escorailles waited a few paces away, still lingered
smilingly before Rougon, asking him at what time she could
see him privately in the Rue Marbeuf, because she felt too
stupid, said she, when he had visitors with him. At this
the colonel, hearing her, suddenly darted back into the room,
and then the others followed, there being a general return.</p>

<p>'We will all come to see you,' the colonel cried.</p>

<p>'You mustn't hide yourself away from every one,' added
several voices. But M. Kahn waved his hand to obtain
silence. And then he made that famous remark of his:
'You don't belong to yourself; you belong to your friends,
and to France.'</p>

<p>At last they all went away, and Rougon was able to close
the door. He heaved a great sigh of relief. Delestang,
whom he had quite forgotten, now made his appearance from
behind the heap of pasteboard boxes, in the shelter of which
he had just finished classifying different papers, like a conscientious
friend. He was feeling a little proud of his work.
He had been acting, while the others had merely been
talking; so it was with genuine satisfaction that he received
the great man's thanks. It was only he, so the latter said,
who could have rendered him this service; he had an orderly
mind, and a methodical manner of working which would
carry him far. And Rougon made other flattering observations,
without it being possible for one to know whether he
was really in earnest or only jesting. Then, turning round,
and glancing into the different corners, he said: 'There, I
think we've finished everything now, thanks to you. There's
nothing more to be done, except to tell Merle to have these
packets carried to my house.'</p>

<p>He called the usher, and pointed out his private papers.
And in reply to all his instructions the usher repeated:
'Yes, Monsieur le Président.'</p>

<p>'Don't call me President any more, you stupid,' Rougon
at last exclaimed in irritation; 'I'm one no longer.'</p>

<p>Merle bowed, and took a step towards the door. Then he
stopped and seemed to hesitate. Finally he came back and
said: 'There's a lady on horseback down below who wants
to see you, sir. She laughed, and said she would come up,
horse and all, if the staircase were wide enough. She declared
that she only wanted to shake hands with you, sir.'</p>

<p>Rougon clenched his fists, thinking this to be some joke;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
but Delestang, who had gone to look out of the window on
the landing, hastened back, exclaiming, with an expression of
emotion: 'Mademoiselle Clorinde!'</p>

<p>Then Rougon said that he would go downstairs; and as
he and Delestang took their hats, he looked at his friend,
and with a frown and a suspicious air, prompted by the
latter's emotion, exclaimed: 'Beware of women!'</p>

<p>When he reached the door, he gave a last glance round
the room. The full light of day was streaming through the
three open windows, illumining the open pasteboard boxes,
the scattered drawers and the packets of papers, tied up and
heaped together in the middle of the carpet. The apartment
looked very spacious and very mournful. In the grate only a
small heap of black ashes was now left of all the handfuls of
burnt papers. And as Rougon closed the door behind him,
the taper, which had been forgotten on the edge of the
writing-table, burnt out, splitting the cut-glass socket of the
candlestick to pieces amid the silence of the empty room.</p>



<hr class="chap">
<h3><a name="III" id="III">III</a></h3>

<h3>MADEMOISELLE CLORINDE</h3>


<p>Rougon occasionally went to Countess Balbi's for a few
minutes towards four in the afternoon. He walked there in
a neighbourly way, for she lived in a small house overlooking
the avenue of the Champs Élysées, only a few yards from the
Rue Marbeuf. She was seldom at home, and when by chance
she did happen to be there she was in bed, and had to send
excuses for not making her appearance. This, however, did not
prevent the staircase of the little house from being crowded
with noisy visitors, or the drawing-room doors from being
perpetually on the swing. Her daughter Clorinde was wont
to receive her friends in a gallery, something like an artist's
studio, with large windows overlooking the avenue.</p>

<p>For nearly three months Rougon, with his blunt distaste
for female wiles, had responded very coldly to the advances of
these ladies, who had managed to get introduced to him at a
ball given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He met them
everywhere, both of them smiling with the same winning
smile—the mother always silent, while the daughter always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
chattered and looked him straight in the face. However, he
still went on avoiding them, lowering his eyes so as not to see
them, and refusing the invitations which they sent him.
Then as they continued to press him hard and pursued him
even to his own house, past which Clorinde used to ride
ostentatiously, he made inquiries before at last venturing to
call on them.</p>

<p>At the Sardinian Legation the ladies were spoken of in
very favourable terms. There had been a real Count Balbi,
it appeared; the Countess still kept up relations with persons
of high position at Turin, and the daughter, during the preceding
year, had been on the point of marrying a petty
German prince. But at the Duchess of Sanquirino's, where
Rougon made his next inquiries, he heard a different story.
There he was told that Clorinde had been born two years
after the Count's death, and a very complicated history of the
Balbis was retailed to him. The husband and wife had led
most adventurous and dissolute lives; they had been divorced
in France, but had afterwards become reconciled to each other
in Italy, their subsequent cohabitation being an illicit one, in
consequence of their previous divorce.</p>

<p>A young attaché, who was thoroughly acquainted with
what went on at the court of King Victor Emmanuel, was
still more explicit. According to him, whatever influence the
Countess still retained in Italy was due to an old connection
with a very highly placed personage there, and he hinted that
she would not have left Turin had it not been for a terrible
scandal into the details of which he would not enter. Rougon,
whose interest in the matter was increasing with the extent
of his inquiries, now went to the police authorities, but they
could give him no precise information. Their entries relating
to the two foreigners simply described them as women who
kept up a great show without any proof that they were really
in possession of a substantial fortune. They asserted that
they had property in Piedmont; but, as a matter of fact, there
were sudden breaks in their life of luxury, during which they
abruptly disappeared, only to reappear shortly afterwards in
fresh splendour. Briefly, all that the police could say was
that they really knew nothing about them and would prefer
to know nothing. At the same time, it was certain that the
women associated with the best society, and that their house
was looked upon as neutral ground, where Clorinde's eccentricities
were tolerated and excused on account of her being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
foreigner. And so Rougon at last made up his mind to see
the ladies.</p>

<p>By the time he had paid his third visit, the great man's
curiosity with respect to them had still further increased. He
was of a cold dispassionate nature which was not easily
stirred into life. What first attracted him in Clorinde was
the mystery surrounding her, the story of a past-away life
and the yearning for a new existence which he could read in
the depths of her big goddess-like eyes. He had heard disgraceful
scandal about her—an early love-affair with a
coachman, and a subsequent connection with a banker who
had presented her with the little house in the Champs
Élysées. However, every now and then she seemed to him
so child-like that he doubted the truth of what he had been
told, and again and again essayed to find out the secret of
this strange girl, who became to him a living enigma, the
solution of which interested him as much as some intricate
political problem. Until then he had felt a scornful disdain
for women, and the first one who excited his interest was
certainly as singular and complicated a being as could be
imagined.</p>

<p>Upon the morrow of the day when Clorinde had gone on
her hired horse to give Rougon a sympathetic shake of the
hand at the door of the Council of State, Rougon himself
went to pay her a visit. She had made him give a solemn
promise to do so. She wanted, she said, to show him something
which would brighten his gloomy moods. He laughingly
called her his 'pet vice'; forgot his worries when he
was with her, and felt cheerful and amused. The more so
as she kept his mind on the alert, for he was still seeking the
key to her history, and was as yet no nearer a solution than
on the first day. As he turned the corner of the Rue Marbeuf,
he glanced at the house in the Rue du Colisée tenanted by
Delestang, whom he fancied he had several times seen peering
through the half open shutters of his study at Clorinde's
window across the avenue; but to-day the shutters were
closed. Delestang had probably gone off to his model-farm
at La Chamade.</p>

<p>The door of the Balbis' house was always wide open. At
the foot of the staircase Rougon met a little dark-complexioned
woman, with untidy hair and a tattered yellow dress. She
was biting at an orange as though it were an apple.</p>

<p>'Is your mistress at home, Antonia?' he asked her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Her mouth was too full to allow her to reply, so she
nodded her head energetically and smiled. Her lips were
streaming with orange juice, and her little eyes, as she
screwed them up, looked like drops of ink upon her dark skin.</p>

<p>Rougon was already accustomed to the irregular ways of
the Balbis' servants, so without more ado he went up the
stairs. On his way he met a big lanky man-servant, with a
face like a brigand's and a long black beard, who coolly stared
at him without giving him the balustrade-side. When he
reached the first floor, he found himself confronted by three
open doors, but saw no one about. The door on his left hand
was that of Clorinde's bedroom. Curiosity prompted him to
peep inside. Although it was four o'clock in the afternoon,
the bed had not been made or the room tidied. Upon a
screen standing in front of the bed and half concealing the
tumbled coverlets, some splashed petticoats which the girl
had worn on the previous day had been hung to dry, while a
wash-basin, full of soapy water, stood on the floor in front
of the window, and the cat of the house, a grey one, slept,
comfortably curled, in the midst of a heap of garments.</p>

<p>It was, however, upon the second floor that Clorinde was
generally to be found, in the gallery which she had successively
turned into a studio, a smoking-room, a hot-house, and
a summer drawing-room. As Rougon ascended upwards he
heard a growing uproar of voices, shrill laughter and a noise
as of furniture being overturned; and when he reached the
door he could distinguish the notes of a consumptive piano
and sounds of singing. He knocked at the door twice without
receiving any answer, and then determined to enter.</p>

<p>'Ah! bravo, bravo, here he is!' cried Clorinde, clapping
her hands.</p>

<p>Rougon, whom it was generally so difficult to put out of
countenance, for a moment remained timidly on the threshold.
Chevalier Rusconi, the Sardinian Minister, a handsome dark-complexioned
man, who, under other circumstances, was a
grave diplomatist, sat in front of the piano, the keys of which
he was striking furiously so as to extract a fuller sound from
the instrument. In the middle of the room deputy La
Rouquette was waltzing with a chair, the back of which he
amorously encircled with his arms, and he was so absorbed
in his amusement that he had littered the carpet with other
chairs which he had overturned. Then, in the bright light
of one of the window-recesses, Clorinde stood upon the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of a table, posing, with perfect unconcern, as the huntress
Diana, in front of a young man who was sketching her with
charcoal upon white canvas. Finally, on a couch, three
serious-looking men with their legs crossed were silently
smoking big cigars and looking at Clorinde.</p>

<p>'Wait a moment! don't move!' cried Chevalier Rusconi
to Clorinde, who was about to jump off the table. 'I am
going to make the presentations.'</p>

<p>Then, followed by Rougon, he said playfully, as he went
past M. La Rouquette, who had dropped breathless into an easy
chair: 'Monsieur La Rouquette whom you know; a future
minister.' And going up to the artist, he continued: 'Signor
Luigi Pozzo, my secretary; diplomatist, painter, musician,
and lover.'</p>

<p>He had overlooked the three men on the couch, but catching
sight of them as he turned round, he dropped his playful
tones, bowed towards them and said in a ceremonious voice:
'Signor Brambilla, Signor Staderino, Signor Viscardi, all
three political refugees.'</p>

<p>The three Venetians bowed without removing their cigars
from their lips. Chevalier Rusconi was returning to the piano
when Clorinde briskly called him back and reproached him
with being a very careless master of the ceremonies. Then,
motioning towards Rougon, she just said, though in a very
significant and flattering tone: 'Monsieur Eugène Rougon.'</p>

<p>Every one bowed again; and Rougon, who for a moment
had been rather afraid of some compromising pleasantry, felt
surprised at the unexpected tact and dignity shown by this
girl, so scantily clad in gauze. He took a seat and inquired
after the Contessa Balbi, as was his custom. He even pretended
every time he came that his visit was intended
for the mother, as this seemed more consonant with strict
propriety.</p>

<p>'I should have been very glad to have paid my respects to
her,' he said, using the formula which he always employed
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>'But mother is there!' exclaimed Clorinde, pointing to a
corner of the room with her bow of gilded wood.</p>

<p>The Countess was indeed there, reclining in a deep easy
chair behind a variety of other furniture. This discovery
came quite as a surprise. The three political refugees had
evidently been unaware of her presence, for they at once rose
from their couch and bowed. Rougon went up and shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
hands with her, standing while she, still lying back in her
chair, answered him in monosyllables with that perpetual
smile of hers which never left her, even when she was ill.
Then she relapsed into listless silence, glancing every now and
then into the avenue along which a stream of carriages was
passing. She had probably taken up her position there in
order to watch the people. And so Rougon soon left her.</p>

<p>Chevalier Rusconi, having again taken his seat at the
piano, was trying to recall a tune, gently striking the keys and
humming some Italian words in a low voice. La Rouquette,
meantime, was fanning himself with his handkerchief;
Clorinde was again seriously impersonating Diana, and
Rougon, in the sudden calm which had come upon the room,
took short steps up and down while looking at the walls.
The gallery was crowded with an extraordinary collection of
articles; a secrétaire, a chest, and several chairs and tables, all
pushed into the middle of the apartment and forming a labyrinth
of narrow passages. At one end of the room some hot-house
plants, crowded together and neglected, were drooping
and dying, their long, pendent leaves already turning yellow;
and at the other end there was a great heap of dried sculptor's
clay, in which one could still recognise the crumbling arms
and legs of a statue which Clorinde had roughly moulded one
day when seized with the whim of becoming an artist.
Although the gallery was very large, there was only one unencumbered
spot in it, a patch in front of one of the windows,
a small square, which had been turned into a kind of little
drawing-room, furnished with a couch and three odd easy
chairs.</p>

<p>'You are at liberty to smoke,' said Clorinde to Rougon.
He thanked her, but told her that he never smoked. Then, without
turning round, the girl cried out: 'Chevalier, make me a
cigarette. The tobacco is in front of you, on the piano.'</p>

<p>While the Chevalier was making the cigarette there was
another interval of silence. Rougon, vexed at finding all
these people present, felt inclined to take up his hat; however,
he turned round and walked up to Clorinde; then raising his
head, he said with a smile: 'Didn't you ask me to call because
you had something to show me?'</p>

<p>She did not immediately reply, but maintained her serious
pose; so he continued: 'What is it that you want to show
me?'</p>

<p>'Myself,' she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>She spoke this word in a majestic tone, not moving a limb
as she stood there on the table in her goddess-like posture.
Rougon, in his turn becoming grave, took a step backward
and scrutinised her. She was truly a superb creature, with
her pure perfect profile, her slender neck, and admirable
classic figure. She rested one hand upon her bow, and preserved
all the antique huntress's expression of serene strength,
regardless of the scantiness of her attire, contemptuous of
the love of man, at once cold, haughty, and immortal.</p>

<p>'Charming, charming!' exclaimed Rougon, not knowing
what else to say.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he found her statuesque immobility
rather disturbing. She looked so triumphant, so convinced
of her classical beauty, that, if he had dared to express his
thoughts, he would have criticised her like some marble statue,
certain details of which displeased his unæsthetic eyes.</p>

<p>'Have you looked enough?' asked Clorinde, still serious
and earnest. 'Wait a moment and you shall see something
else.'</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, she was no longer Diana. She
dropped her bow and assumed another, and more syren-like
posture. Her hands were thrown behind her head and
clasped together in her hair; her bust bent slightly backwards,
and, as she half-opened her lips and smiled, a stream
of sunshine lighted up her face. And standing thus she
looked like the very goddess of love.</p>

<p>Signor Brambilla, Signor Staderino, and Signor Viscardi
broke into applause in all seriousness, never casting off their
gloomy conspirator-like mien.</p>

<p>'Brava! brava! brava!'</p>

<p>On his side M. La Rouquette was quite frantic with enthusiasm,
and Chevalier Rusconi, who had stepped up to the
table to hand the girl the cigarette which he had made for
her, remained transfixed there, gazing at her with ecstatic
eyes and slightly jogging his head as though beating time to
his admiration.</p>

<p>Rougon said nothing, but clasped his hands so tightly
together that their joints cracked. A subtle tremor had just
sped through him. He no longer thought of going away, but
dropped into a chair. Clorinde had already resumed her easy,
natural pose, and was laughing and smoking her cigarette
with a proud twist of her lips. It would have delighted her,
said she, to be an actress. She could personate anger, tenderness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
modesty, fright, and with a turn of her features or an
attitude hit off all sorts of different people.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Rougon,' she asked abruptly, 'would you like
to see me imitate you when you are addressing the Chamber?'
And thereupon she drew herself up to her full height, puffed
herself out and thrust her fists in front of her with such droll,
yet truthful, mimicry, that they all nearly killed themselves
with laughing. Rougon roared like a boy. He found Clorinde
adorable, indeed exquisite, but also very disturbing.</p>

<p>'Clorinde, Clorinde!' cried Luigi, gently tapping his
easel.</p>

<p>She was moving about so restlessly that he was obliged to
desist from his work. He had now laid his charcoal aside
and was putting colour on the canvas with an earnest air.
He himself remained quite serious amidst all the laughter,
raising his glistening eyes to the young girl and then glancing
fiercely at the men with whom she was joking. It was his
own idea to paint her in the character of Diana, in a costume
which had been the talk of all Paris ever since the ball at the
embassy. He claimed to be her cousin, as they had both been
born in the same street in Florence.</p>

<p>'Clorinde!' he repeated almost angrily.</p>

<p>'Luigi is right,' she then exclaimed, 'you are not behaving
properly, gentlemen. What a noise you are making! Come,
let us get on with our work.'</p>

<p>Then she once more assumed her Olympian attitude, again
presenting the semblance of a beautiful marble image. The
men remained where they were, keeping perfectly still, as
though rooted to the floor. La Rouquette alone ventured to
beat a gentle tattoo with his finger-tips on the arms of his
chair. Rougon, for his part, sat back and gazed at Clorinde,
and gradually fell into a dreamy state in which the girl
seemed to him to expand into gigantic proportions. A woman
was certainly a wonderful piece of mechanism, he reflected. It
was a matter that he had never before thought of studying;
but now he began to have vague mental glimpses of extraordinary
intricacies. For a moment he was filled with a
distinct consciousness of the power of those bare shoulders,
which seemed strong enough to shake a world. All swam
before him, and Clorinde's figure seemed to grow larger and
larger till it appeared gigantic, and entirely hid the window
from his sight. But he blinked his eyes sharply, and then
he again saw her clearly, standing upon the table and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
smaller than himself. At this his face broke into a smile,
and he felt surprised that he could have entertained a
moment's fear of her.</p>

<p>At the other end of the gallery some talk was now going
on in low tones. Rougon listened from force of habit, but
could only distinguish a rapid murmur of Italian syllables.
Chevalier Rusconi, who had just glided behind his chair, had
laid one hand on the back of the Countess's seat, and, bending
over her respectfully, seemed to be telling her some long
story. The Countess said nothing, but nodded every now
and again. Once, however, she made an energetic gesture of
negation, whereupon the Chevalier bent still closer and tranquillised
her with his melodious voice, the murmur of which
was like the warbling of a song-bird. At last Rougon,
through his knowledge of the dialect of Provence, caught a
few words which made him grave.</p>

<p>'Mother,' Clorinde cried abruptly, 'have you shown the
Chevalier the telegram you received last night?'</p>

<p>'A telegram!' exclaimed the Chevalier in a loud tone.</p>

<p>The Countess drew a bundle of letters from her pocket
and began to search amongst them. Then she handed the
Chevalier a much crumpled strip of blue paper.</p>

<p>As soon as he had glanced over it he made a gesture of
anger and astonishment. 'What!' he cried in French, forgetting
the presence of the others, 'you knew this yesterday!
And I only learnt it this morning!'</p>

<p>Clorinde indulged in a fresh burst of laughter, which increased
his irritation.</p>

<p>'And Madame la Comtesse allows me to tell her the whole
story, as though she knew nothing about it!' he continued.
'Well, as the head-quarters of the legation seem to be here, I
shall call every day to see the correspondence.'</p>

<p>The Countess smiled. She again searched in her bundle
of letters and took out a second paper which she gave the
Chevalier to read. This time he seemed much pleased. Then
they renewed their conversation in whispers, the Chevalier's
face once more wearing a respectful smile. Before he left the
Countess, he kissed her hand.</p>

<p>'There! we've done with business,' he said in a low
voice as he took his seat at the piano again.</p>

<p>Then he rattled off a vulgar air which was very popular
in Paris that year. But having ascertained what time it was,
he suddenly sprang up to get his hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>'Are you going?' asked Clorinde. Then she beckoned
him to her, and leaning on his shoulder whispered something
into his ear. He nodded and smiled; and finally said:
'Capital, capital. I will write and mention it.'</p>

<p>At last he bowed to the company and retired. Luigi
tapped Clorinde, who was squatting on the table, with his
maul-stick, in order to make her stand up again. The
Countess appeared to have grown tired of watching the
stream of carriages in the avenue, for she pulled the bell-rope
that hung behind her as soon as she lost sight of the Chevalier's
brougham, which quickly disappeared among the crowd
of landaus coming back from the Bois. It was the big lanky
man-servant with the brigand's face who answered her summons,
leaving the door wide open behind him. Leaning
heavily on his arm, she slowly crossed the room, the men
standing up and bowing as she passed. She acknowledged
their salutations with a smiling nod. When she reached the
door, she turned and said to Clorinde: 'I have got my headache
again; I'm going to lie down a little.'</p>

<p>'Flaminio,' called the young girl to the servant who was
assisting her mother, 'put a hot iron at her feet.'</p>

<p>The three political refugees did not sit down again. For
a few moments they remained standing in a row, finishing
their cigars, the stumps of which they then threw, each with
the same precise gesture, behind the heap of dry clay. And
afterwards they filed past Clorinde, going off in procession.</p>

<p>M. La Rouquette had just commenced a serious conversation
with Rougon. 'Yes, indeed,' he remarked, 'I know very
well that this question of sugars is one of the greatest importance.
It affects a whole branch of French commerce. But
unfortunately nobody in the Chamber seems to have thoroughly
studied the subject.'</p>

<p>Rougon, whom he bored, only answered with a nod. However,
the young deputy drew closer to him, an expression of
sudden gravity coming over his girlish face as he continued:
'I myself have an uncle in the sugar trade. He has one of
the largest refining-houses at Marseilles. I went to stay with
him for three months, and I took notes, very copious notes.
I talked to the workmen and made myself conversant with
the whole subject. I intended, you understand, to make a
speech in the Chamber on the matter.'</p>

<p>In this wise he tried to show off before Rougon, giving
himself a deal of trouble in order to talk to him on the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
subjects which he thought would interest him; and, at the
same time, being anxious to pass for a sound politician.</p>

<p>'And didn't you make a speech?' interposed Clorinde,
who seemed to be growing impatient of M. La Rouquette's
presence.</p>

<p>'No, I didn't,' he replied; 'I thought I'd better not. At
the last moment I felt afraid that my figures might not be
quite correct.'</p>

<p>Rougon eyed him keenly and then gravely asked him:
'Do you know how many pieces of sugar are consumed every
day at the Café Anglais?'</p>

<p>For a moment La Rouquette seemed quite confused and
stared at the other with a blank expression. Then he broke
into a peal of laughter. 'Ah! very good! very good!' he
cried. 'I understand now. You are chaffing me. But that's
a question of sugar. What I was speaking about was a question
of sugars. Very good that, eh? You'll let me repeat
the joke, won't you?'</p>

<p>He wriggled on his chair with much self-satisfaction. The
rosy hue came back to his cheeks and he seemed quite at
his ease again, once more talking in his natural light manner.
Clorinde attacked him on the subject of women. She had
seen him, she said, two nights previously at the Variétés with
a little fair person who was very plain and had hair like a
poodle's. At first the young man denied the accusation; but,
irritated by Clorinde's cruel remarks about the 'little poodle,'
he at last forgot himself and began to defend her, saying that
she was a highly respectable lady and not nearly so bad looking
as Clorinde tried to make out. The girl, however, grew
quite scathing, and finally M. La Rouquette cried out: 'She's
expecting me now, and I must be off.'</p>

<p>As soon as he had closed the door behind him, Clorinde
clapped her hands triumphantly, and exclaimed: 'There, he's
gone at last. Good riddance to him.'</p>

<p>Then she jumped lightly from the table, ran up to Rougon,
and gave him both her hands. Assuming her most winning
look, she expressed her regret that he had not found her alone.
What a lot of trouble she had had to get all those people to
go! Some people couldn't understand anything! What a
goose La Rouquette was with his sugars! Now, however,
there was no one to disturb them, and they could talk. She
had led Rougon to a couch as she was speaking, and he had
sat down without releasing her hands, when Luigi began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
tap his easel with his maul-stick, exclaiming in a tone of
irritation: 'Clorinde! Clorinde!'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, of course, the portrait,' she cried, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Then she made her escape from Rougon, and bent down
behind the artist with a soft caressing expression. How
pretty his work looked, she cried. It was very good indeed;
but, really, she felt rather tired and would much like a quarter
of an hour's rest. He could go on with the dress in the meantime.
There was no occasion for her to pose for the dress.
Luigi, however, cast fiery glances at Rougon, and muttered
disagreeable words. Thereupon Clorinde hastily said something
to him in Italian, knitting her brows the while, though
still continuing to smile. This reduced Luigi to silence, and
he began to pass his brush over the canvas again.</p>

<p>'It's quite true what I say,' declared the girl as she came
back and sat down beside Rougon; 'my left leg is quite
numb.'</p>

<p>Then she slapped herself to make the blood circulate, she
explained; and she was bending towards Rougon, her bare
shoulder touching his coat, when she suddenly looked at herself
and blushed deeply. And forthwith she sprang up and
fetched a piece of black lace which she wrapped around her.</p>

<p>'I feel chilly,' she said, when she had wheeled an easy
chair in front of Rougon and sat down in it.</p>

<p>Nothing but her bare wrists now peeped out from beneath
her lace wrapper, which she had knotted round her neck.
Her bust was completely concealed in its folds, and her face
had turned pale and grave.</p>

<p>'Well, what is it that has happened to you?' she
exclaimed. 'Tell me all about it.'</p>

<p>Then she questioned him about his fall from office with
daughterly curiosity. She was a foreigner, she told him, and
she made him again and again repeat certain details which
she said she did not understand. She also kept on interrupting
him with Italian ejaculations, and he could read in her
dark eyes the interest she took in what he was telling her.
Why had he quarrelled with the Emperor? How could he
have brought himself to give up such a lofty position? Who
were his enemies, that he should have allowed himself to be
worsted in that way? And as he hesitated, unwilling to make
the confessions which she tried to extort from him, she looked
at him with an expression of such affectionate candour, that
at last he threw off all reserve and told her the whole story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
from beginning to end. She soon seemed to have learnt all
that she wanted to know, and then began to ask him questions
quite unconnected with the matter which had first engaged
her attention, questions so singular that Rougon was altogether
surprised. But at last she clasped her hands and lapsed
into silence. Closing her eyes she seemed buried in deep
thought.</p>

<p>'Well?' said Rougon, with a smile.</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing,' she murmured, 'but this has made me
quite sad.'</p>

<p>Rougon was touched, and tried to take hold of her hands
again, but she hid them away in her lace wrapper, and they
both sat there in silence for a minute or two, when she opened
her eyes again and said: 'You have formed some plans, I
suppose?'</p>

<p>Rougon looked at her keenly, with a touch of suspicion.
But she seemed so adorable as she languidly reclined in that
easy chair, as though the troubles of her 'dear friend' had
broken her down, that he dismissed the chilling thought. Moreover,
she plied him with flattery. She was sure, said she,
that he would not long be allowed to remain aloof, but
would be master again some day. She was confident that
he had high ambitions and trusted hopefully in his star, for
she could plainly read as much on his brow. Why wouldn't
he take her for his confidante? She was very discreet, and
it would make her so happy to share his hopes for the future.
Rougon, quite infatuated by all this, and still trying to grasp
the little hands hidden away beneath the lace, thereupon
kept nothing back, but confessed everything to the girl, his
hopes as well as his certainties. He required no further
urging from her, and she had only to let him talk on, refraining
even from a gesture for fear of checking him. She kept
her eyes upon him, examining him searchingly limb by limb,
fathoming his skull, weighing his shoulders and measuring
his chest. He was certainly a solid, well-built man, who,
with a turn of his wrist, could have tossed her, strong as she
was, on to his back and have carried her without the least
difficulty to whatever height she might have desired.</p>

<p>'Ah! my dear friend,' she exclaimed abruptly, 'it is not I
who have ever felt any doubts.'</p>

<p>Then she sprang from her seat, and, spreading out her
arms, let the lace wrapper slip off. A momentary all-alluring
vision, a sort of promise and reward, appeared to Rougon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
'Ah!' she cried, 'my lace has fallen,' and quickly picking it
up again, she knotted it round her more tightly than before.</p>

<p>'Oh!' she next exclaimed, 'there's Luigi growling.'</p>

<p>Then she hastened back to the artist, bent over him a
second time and rapidly whispered to him. Rougon, now
that she was no longer by his side, roughly rubbed his hands
together, feeling almost angry. That girl had exercised a
most extraordinary influence over him and he resented it. If
he had been a lad of twenty he could not have acted more
foolishly. She had wheedled him into a confession as though
he had been a mere child; whereas he, for the last two
months, had been doing his best to make her speak, but had
only succeeded in extracting peals of laughter from her.
She, however, had merely had to deny him her little
hands for a moment, and he had foolishly forgotten all his
prudence and told her everything in order to gain possession
of them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Rougon smiled a smile of conscious strength.
He could break her, he told himself, whenever he liked.
Wasn't it she herself who was challenging him? He certainly
could not go on playing the part of an imbecile with
this girl who so freely showed him her shoulders. He was
by no means sure that the lace wrapper had slipped off without
her assistance.</p>

<p>'Would you say that my eyes were grey?' Clorinde now
asked him, stepping towards him again.</p>

<p>He rose and looked at her quite closely, but she bore his
inspection without even her eyelids quivering. However,
when he stretched forth his hands, she gave him a tap.
There was no occasion to touch her. She had become very
cold, now. She wrapped herself yet more closely in her
strip of lace, and her modesty seemed to take alarm at the
least hole in it. In vain did Rougon joke and jest. She
only covered herself the more, and even refused to sit down
again.</p>

<p>'I prefer walking about a little,' she said; 'it stretches
my legs.'</p>

<p>Then Rougon followed her and they paced the room
together. He tried, in his turn, to extract a confession from
her. As a rule, she could not be got to answer questions.
Her conversation usually consisted of sudden starts and
jumps, interspersed with ejaculations and snatches of stories
which she never finished. When Rougon adroitly questioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
her concerning the fortnight of the previous month which she
and her mother had spent away from Paris, she started on an interminable
string of anecdotes about her journeyings. She had
been everywhere, to England, Spain, and Germany; and she
had seen everything. Then she vented a series of trifling
remarks upon food, and the fashions and the weather. Now
and then she began some story, in which she herself figured
with sundry well-known persons, whom she named; and,
thereupon, Rougon listened attentively, hoping that she was
at last going to make some real revelation; but she either
turned the story off into some childish nonsense or stopped
short and left it unfinished altogether. That day, as previously,
he learnt absolutely nothing. Her face retained
its impenetrable smile, and she remained full of secretive
reserve amidst all her boisterous freedom. Rougon, quite
confused by the different extraordinary stories he had heard
of her, each of which gave the lie to the other, was utterly
unable to determine whether he had before him a mere girl
whose innocence extended even to foolishness, or a keen-witted
woman who cunningly affected simplicity.</p>

<p>She was telling him of an adventure that had happened
to her in a little town in Spain, and of the gallantry of a
traveller who had given up his room to her, when she suddenly
broke off and exclaimed: 'You mustn't go back to the
Tuileries. Make yourself missed.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, Mademoiselle Machiavelli,' he replied, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>She laughed louder than he did, but none the less she
went on giving him excellent advice. However, as he still
sportively tried to pinch her arms, she seemed to grow vexed
and declared that it was impossible to talk to him seriously
for a couple of minutes together. Ah! if she were a man, she
said, she would know how to mount high. But men were so
light-headed. 'Come now and tell me about your friends,'
she continued, seating herself on the edge of the table, while
Rougon remained standing in front of her.</p>

<p>Just then, however, Luigi, who had kept his eyes on them,
violently closed his paint-box and exclaimed: 'I'm going!'</p>

<p>At this Clorinde ran up to him, and brought him back,
after promising to resume her pose. Probably, however, her
only motive in asking him to remain was that she felt afraid
of being left alone with Rougon, for when Luigi had assented
to her request, she began to make further excuses for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
purpose of gaining time. 'Just let me get something to
eat,' she said; 'I am dreadfully hungry. Just a couple of
mouthfuls.' And then opening the door, she called out:
'Antonia! Antonia!'</p>

<p>She gave an order in Italian, and had just seated herself
again on the edge of the table when Antonia came into the
room, holding on each of her outspread hands, a slice of
bread and butter. She held her hands out to Clorinde as
though they had been plates, breaking into a giggle as she
did so, a laugh which made her mouth look like a red gash
across her dusky face. Then she went off, wiping her hands
on her skirt. Clorinde, however, called her back and told
her to get a glass of water.</p>

<p>'Will you have some?' she said to Rougon, 'I'm very
fond of bread and butter. Sometimes I put sugar on it;
but it doesn't always do to be so extravagant.'</p>

<p>She was certainly not given to extravagance, and Rougon
remembered that he had found her one morning breakfasting
off a fragment of cold omelet which had been left over from
the previous day. He rather suspected her of avarice, which
is an Italian vice.</p>

<p>'Three minutes, eh, Luigi?' she said, as she began her
first slice of bread and butter. Then turning once more to
Rougon, who was still standing in front of her, she exclaimed:
'Now there's Monsieur Kahn, for instance: tell me
about him. How did he get to be a deputy?'</p>

<p>Rougon yielded to this fresh request, hoping that he
would somehow be able to worm some information out of the
girl. He knew that she was very curious about everyone,
ever on the alert to gather information concerning the
intrigues in the midst of which her life was passed. She
always seemed particularly anxious to know the origin of any
great fortune.</p>

<p>'Oh!' he replied, with a laugh, 'Kahn was born a
deputy. He cut his teeth on the benches of the Chamber.
As early as Louis Philippe's time he sat in the Right centre
and supported the constitutional monarchy with youthful
enthusiasm. After 1848 he went over to the Left centre,
still keeping very enthusiastic. He made a confession of
republican principles in magnificent style. Now, however,
he has gone back to the Right centre and is a passionate
supporter of the Empire. As for the rest, he's the son of a
Jewish banker at Bordeaux. He has some blast furnaces at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Bressuire, has made a specialty of financial and industrial
questions, lives in a quiet way until he comes into the large
fortune which he will one day secure, and was promoted to
the rank of officer in the Legion of Honour on the fifteenth
of last August——'</p>

<p>Rougon hesitated for a moment and seemed to be
thinking. 'No,' he resumed, 'I don't think I have omitted
anything. He has no children.'</p>

<p>'What! is he married?' exclaimed Clorinde, indicating
by a gesture that she took no further interest in M.
Kahn. He was an impostor: he had never let them know
that he had a wife. Rougon thereupon explained to her that
Madame Kahn led a very retired life in Paris; and without
waiting to be questioned further, he continued: 'Would you
like to hear Béjuin's biography?'</p>

<p>'No, no,' replied the girl.</p>

<p>All the same, however, he went on with it. 'He comes
from the Polytechnical School. He has written pamphlets
which nobody has read. He is head of the Saint-Florent
cut-glass works, about seven or eight miles from Bourges. It
was the prefect of the Cher who discovered him——'</p>

<p>'Oh, give over!' cried Clorinde.</p>

<p>'He is a very worthy fellow, votes straight, never speaks,
is very patient and waits contentedly till you think of him,
but he is always on the spot to take care that you sha'n't
forget him. I got him named chevalier——'</p>

<p>Thereupon Clorinde impatiently placed her hand over
Rougon's mouth, and exclaimed: 'Oh, he is married too!
He isn't a bit interesting. I saw his wife at your house.
She's a perfect bundle! She invited me to visit the works
at Bourges.'</p>

<p>She now swallowed the last mouthful of her first slice of
bread and butter, and then gulped down some water. 'And
Monsieur Du Poizat?' she asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>'Du Poizat has been a sub-prefect,' was all that Rougon
replied.</p>

<p>She glanced at him, surprised by the brevity of this
account. 'I know that,' she said. 'What else?'</p>

<p>'Well, by-and-bye he will be a prefect, and then he will
be decorated.'</p>

<p>She saw that he did not want to say anything further
about Du Poizat; whose name, moreover, she herself had
merely mentioned at random. However, she now began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
mention other men, counting their names on her fingers.
Touching her thumb, she began: 'Monsieur d'Escorailles;
he's flippant and in love with every woman—Monsieur La
Rouquette; he's no good, I know him only too well—Monsieur
de Combelot; he's another married man——'</p>

<p>Then, as she stopped short at the ring-finger, unable to
think of another name, Rougon, keeping his eyes on her,
remarked: 'You are forgetting Delestang.'</p>

<p>'So I am!' she exclaimed. 'Tell me about him!'</p>

<p>'He's a handsome fellow,' said Rougon, still watching
her attentively. 'He is very rich, and I have always prophesied
a great future for him.'</p>

<p>He went on in this strain, exaggerating his praises and
doubling his figures. The model-farm of La Chamade, said
he, was worth a couple of million francs. Delestang would
certainly be a minister some day. Clorinde, however, curled
her lips disdainfully. 'He is a big booby,' she said at last.</p>

<p>'What?' cried Rougon with a subtle smile. He seemed
quite charmed by her remark.</p>

<p>But with one of those sudden transitions which were
habitual with her, she asked him a fresh question, keenly
scrutinising him in her turn: 'You must know Monsieur de
Marsy very well?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes, we know each other,' he replied unconcernedly,
amused that the girl should have asked him such a question.
Then he became serious, and showed himself very dignified
and impartial. 'Marsy is a man of extraordinary intelligence,'
he continued. 'I am honoured by having such a
man for my enemy. He has filled every position. At
twenty-eight years of age, he was a colonel. Later on, he
was at the head of a great business. And since then, he has
successively occupied himself with agriculture, finance and
commerce. I hear, too, that he paints portraits and writes
novels.'</p>

<p>Clorinde had grown thoughtful, and was forgetting her
bread and butter. 'I was talking to him the other day,' she
said in a low tone. 'He's perfect—a genuine queen's son.'</p>

<p>'In my estimation,' continued Rougon, 'it is his wit that
spoils him. My idea of ability is quite different. I have
heard him making puns under the gravest circumstances.
Well, anyhow, he has been very successful, and is as much
the sovereign as the Emperor himself. All these natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
children<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are lucky fellows. However, his greatest characteristic
is his grip of iron; he has firm and resolute hands,
though they are light and slender.'</p>

<p>Clorinde unconsciously let her eyes wander to Rougon's
hands, so large and powerful. He noticed it, and with a
smile continued: 'Ah, mine are mere paws, aren't they?
That's why Marsy and I have never been able to get on well
together. He gallantly sabres his foes without soiling his
white gloves, while I knock mine down.'</p>

<p>Thereupon he clenched his heavy hairy fists and shook
them, seemingly proud of their enormous size. Clorinde took
up her second slice of bread and butter and dug her teeth
into it, still absorbed in thought. At length she raised her
eyes to Rougon's face. 'And now about yourself?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'Ah, you want to hear my history, do you?' said he.
'Well, it's very easily told. My grandfather sold vegetables.
I myself, till I was thirty-eight years of age, kicked up my
heels as a country lawyer in the depths of the provinces.
Yesterday I was unknown, for I haven't, like our friend Kahn,
helped to back up every Government in turn, and I haven't
come, like Béjuin, from the Polytechnical School. I can't
boast of little Escorailles' fine name or poor Combelot's
handsome face. I haven't even as good family connections
as La Rouquette, who is indebted for his seat in the Chamber
to his sister, the widow of General de Llorentz and now a
lady-in-waiting. My father did not leave me five million
francs gained in the wine trade, as Delestang's left him. I
wasn't born on the steps of a throne, like Count de Marsy
was, nor have I grown up tied to the apron-strings of a clever
woman, under the favour of Talleyrand. No, I'm a self-made
man; I've only my own hands——'</p>

<p>Then he clapped his hands together, laughing loudly, and
turning what he had said into a joke. Finally he braced
himself to his full height and looked as though he were
crushing stones with his clenched fists. Clorinde gazed at
him admiringly.</p>

<p>'I was nothing; I shall now be whatever I like,' he continued,
as though he were speaking to himself and had
forgotten the presence of others. 'I am a power. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
other fellows make me shrug my shoulders when they prate
of their devotion to the Empire! Do they really care for it?
Do they appreciate it? Wouldn't they conform to all kinds
of governments? For my own part, I have grown up with
the Empire! I have made it, and it has made me! I was
named a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour after the tenth
of December, an officer in January 1851, a commander on the
fifteenth of August 1854, and a grand officer three months
ago. Under the Presidency, I was entrusted for a short time
with the portfolio of Public Works; later on the Emperor
gave me a mission to England, and since then I have entered
the Council of State and the Senate——'</p>

<p>'And, to-morrow, what will you enter?' Clorinde interrupted
with a laugh, by which she tried to conceal her ardent
curiosity.</p>

<p>He stopped short and looked at her. 'You are very
inquisitive, Mademoiselle Machiavelli,' he said.</p>

<p>Then Clorinde began to swing her legs more briskly, and
there was an interval of silence. Rougon, seeing her absorbed
in a fresh reverie, thought that a favourable moment had
come for extorting a confession from her. 'Women——' he
began.</p>

<p>But in a low tone she interrupted him, smiling at her own
thoughts, with a vague expression in her eyes: 'Oh, women
are quite different!'</p>

<p>This was all the confession she made. She finished her
bread and butter and drained her glass of water. Then she
leapt to her feet on the table, with a spring that testified to
her adroitness as a horsewoman. 'Now, Luigi!' she cried.</p>

<p>For the last few minutes the artist, who had left his seat,
had been impatiently gnawing his moustache while irritably
walking up and down in front of Rougon and Clorinde. With
a sigh, he now sat down again and took up his palette. The
three minutes' grace which Clorinde had asked for had
expanded into a quarter of an hour. Now, however, she was
again standing on the table, still enveloped in her black lace.
When she had set herself in the proper attitude, she uncovered
herself with a light movement of the hand, and became a
marble statue once more.</p>

<p>Fewer carriages were now rolling along the Champs
Élysées, over which the declining sun cast a stream of hazy
light, enveloping the trees in a ruddy haze that might almost
have been taken for a coating of dust stirred up by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
passing vehicles. Clorinde's shoulders gleamed as with
sheeny gold in the light that fell through the lofty windows.
The sky gradually became greyer.</p>

<p>'Is Monsieur de Marsy's intended marriage with the
Wallachian princess settled yet?' asked the girl.</p>

<p>'Yes, I think so,' Rougon replied. 'She is very rich, and
Marsy is always short of money. And they say, too, that he
is madly in love with her.'</p>

<p>A spell of silence followed. Rougon stayed on, perfectly
at his ease, without any further thought of going away. He
was absorbed in meditation, and began to pace the room
again. That Clorinde, he said to himself, was certainly a
remarkably fascinating creature. He thought of her as
though he had left her some time ago; and, as he walked up
and down, with his eyes turned to the floor, his mind dwelt
on dimly formulated, but very alluring thoughts, from which
he derived a tender pleasure. He seemed, moreover, to be
breathing some strangely perfumed atmosphere, and would
have liked to throw himself upon one of the couches and drop
off to sleep amidst that odorous air.</p>

<p>A sound of words suddenly recalled him to himself. A
tall old man, whose entrance he had not observed, was kissing
Clorinde on the brow, while the girl smilingly stooped over
the edge of the table.</p>

<p>'Good-morning, my dear,' said the old gentleman. 'How
pretty you look! You are exhibiting your charms, I see.'
Then he gave a little snigger, and as Clorinde in confusion
picked up her lace wrapper, he quickly added: 'No, no!
You are very nice as you are! You needn't be afraid
of us.'</p>

<p>Then he turned towards Rougon, whom he addressed as
'dear colleague,' as he shook his hand. 'I dandled her many
a time on my knees, when she was a little thing,' he added.
'Ah! what a dazzling creature she is now!'</p>

<p>The new-comer was M. de Plouguern. He was seventy
years of age. A representative of Finistère in the Chamber
during the reign of Louis Philippe, he had been one of those
Legitimist deputies who made the pilgrimage to Belgrave
Square,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and he had resigned in consequence of the vote of
censure then passed upon himself and his companions. Later
on, after the Revolution of February 1848, he had manifested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a sudden affection for the Republic, which he vigorously
applauded from the benches of the Constituent Assembly.
Now that the Emperor had granted him the well-earned refuge
of the Senate, he was a Bonapartist. But he knew how to be
a Bonapartist and a man of high birth and breeding at the
same time. With all his great humility he occasionally
indulged in a spice of opposition. Ingratitude amused him,
and, though he was a sceptic to the backbone, he defended
religion and family-life. He thought that he owed that much
to his name, one of the most illustrious in Brittany. Accordingly
every now and then he found the Empire immoral, and
said so openly. He himself had lived a life of dissolute intrigue
and elaborate pleasure-seeking, and stories were told even
of his old age which set young men dreaming. It was during
a journey in Italy that he had first met Countess Balbi, whose
lover he had remained for nearly thirty years. After separations,
which lasted sometimes for years, they would come
together for a short time in some town where they happened
to meet. According to some, Clorinde was his daughter;
however, since the girl had grown up and had become a plump
and pretty young woman, he asserted, while gazing at her
with his still glistening eyes, that he had known her father
well in former days. At the same time he treated her with
considerable freedom as being an old friend. This tall,
withered, scraggy old Plouguern bore some resemblance to
Voltaire; and the likeness was the source of much secret
pleasure to him.</p>

<p>'You don't look at my portrait, godfather,' Clorinde said
to him all at once.</p>

<p>She called him godfather by reason of their intimacy.
The old man stepped behind Luigi, and screwed up his eyes
with the air of a connoisseur. 'Splendid!' he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Rougon also came up, and Clorinde herself jumped off the
table to get a better view. All three of them were delighted.
The picture was excellent, they said. The artist had already
covered the entire canvas with a thin coating of pink and
white and yellow, as pale as though it were a mere water-colour
wash. The face was wreathed into a pretty dollish
smile, the lips were curved into a bow, and the eyebrows
symmetrically arched, while the cheeks glowed with soft vermilion.
It was a Diana, fit for the lid of some box of
sweetmeats.</p>

<p>'Oh, just look at that little freckle close to the eye!' cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Clorinde, clapping her hands in admiration: 'Luigi forgets
nothing!'</p>

<p>Rougon, whom pictures generally wearied, was charmed.
Just then he appreciated art, and in a tone of earnest conviction
he pronounced this judgment: 'It is admirably
drawn.'</p>

<p>'And the colouring is excellent,' added M. de Plouguern.
'Those shoulders look like real flesh. And what arms! But
the dear child has really got the most wonderful arms! I
admire that full roundness below the bend of the arm immensely;
it is perfect.' Then, turning to the artist, he
added: 'Pray accept my compliments, Monsieur Pozzo. I
have already seen a picture of a woman bathing by you. But
this portrait will certainly excel it. Why don't you exhibit?
I knew a diplomatist who played marvellously well upon the
violin, and yet it didn't prevent him from attaining great
success in his profession.'</p>

<p>Luigi bowed, feeling highly flattered. The daylight was
now fast waning, and so, saying that he wished to finish an
ear, he begged Clorinde to resume her position for another
ten minutes. Meantime, M. de Plouguern and Rougon went
on discussing art. The latter confessed that his special
studies had prevented him from following the artistic movement
of recent years, but he expressed great admiration for
fine productions. He went on to say that he was not much
affected by colour, but preferred good drawing—drawing which
was capable of elevating the soul and inspiring it with great
thoughts. M. de Plouguern, on his side, only cared about
the old masters. He had visited all the galleries in Europe,
and could not understand, said he, how the moderns had the
hardihood to go on painting. All the same, he confessed that
only the previous month he had had a little room of his
decorated by an artist who was quite unknown, but who
certainly possessed great genius.</p>

<p>'He has painted me some little cupids and flowers and
foliage with extraordinary skill. You might positively think
you could pluck the flowers. And there are some insects on
them, butterflies, cockchafers, and flies, which you could
almost swear were alive. It is very amusing. I like amusing
pictures.'</p>

<p>'Art should not weary one,' retorted Rougon.</p>

<p>Just at this moment, as they were slowly pacing the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
side by side, one of M. de Plouguern's boot-heels crushed
something which gave out a sharp sound.</p>

<p>'Hallo! What's that?' he cried.</p>

<p>Then he picked up a chaplet, which had slipped off an
arm-chair into which Clorinde had doubtless emptied her
pockets. One of the glass beads near the cross had been
shivered to atoms, and an arm of the cross itself, a very small
silver one, was bent and flattened. The old man dangled the
chaplet in his hand, and said with a slight snigger: 'My
dear, why do you leave these playthings of yours lying
about?'</p>

<p>Clorinde, however, had turned quite crimson. She sprang
off the table, with swollen lips, and tears of anger welling into
her eyes, and, as she rapidly covered up her shoulders, she
stammered: 'Oh, the wretch! the wretch! he has broken
my chaplet!'</p>

<p>She snatched it from him, and then burst into sobs like a
child.</p>

<p>'There! there!' said M. de Plouguern, still laughing.
'Just look at my little devotee! The other day she nearly
tore my eyes out because I noticed a branch of palm over her
bed and asked her what she used that little besom for.
There now, don't cry, you great goose! I haven't broken
your Divinity.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' she cried, 'you have injured it.' With trembling
hands she removed the fragments of the bead, and then, with
a fresh outburst of sobs, she tried to put the cross right again.
She wiped it with her finger tips, as though she saw drops
of blood oozing through the metal.</p>

<p>'It was the Pope who gave me this,' she sobbed, 'the first
time I went with mother to see him. He knows me very
well, and he calls me his "fair apostle," because I told him
one day that I should be glad to die for him. It was a
chaplet that brought me good luck. But now it has lost its
virtue, and it will attract the devil——'</p>

<p>'Here, give it to me!' interrupted M. de Plouguern,
'you will only break your nails by trying to straighten it.
Silver is hard, my dear.'</p>

<p>He took the chaplet from her and tried to straighten the
arm of the cross, using great care so as not to break it.
Clorinde had ceased crying, and watched him attentively.
Rougon, too, smilingly craned his head forward. He was
deplorably irreligious; so much so, indeed, that the girl had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
twice all but broken with him on account of his ill-considered
pleasantries.</p>

<p>'The deuce!' muttered M. de Plouguern, 'this divinity of
yours isn't very tender! I'm afraid of snapping it in two,
and then you would have to get another one.'</p>

<p>He made a fresh attempt and this time the arm of the
cross broke off. 'Oh! so much the worse!' he cried; 'it is
broken this time.'</p>

<p>At this Rougon began to laugh again. But Clorinde,
with angry eyes and convulsed face, sprang back glaring at
them, and then fell upon them furiously with her fists, as
though she wished to drive them out of the room. She railed
at them in Italian, quite beside herself.</p>

<p>'She's giving it us! she's giving it us!' cried M. de
Plouguern gaily.</p>

<p>'Such are the fruits of superstition,' muttered Rougon
between his teeth.</p>

<p>The old man ceased his jesting and suddenly assumed a
grave expression; and then as Rougon continued to declaim
in conventional phraseology against the detestable influence
of the priesthood, the shocking training of Catholic women,
and the degradation of priest-ridden Italy, the other drily
exclaimed: 'Religion makes the greatness of states.'</p>

<p>'When it doesn't eat them away like an ulcer,' replied
Rougon. 'It's matter of history. If the Emperor doesn't
keep the Bishops in check, he will soon have them all on his
back.'</p>

<p>Thereupon M. de Plouguern in his turn grew angry. He
defended Rome, and talked of what had been the convictions
of his whole life. Without religion, he protested, men would
return to the condition of brutes. Then he went on to plead
the great cause of family ties. The times were becoming full
of abomination. Never before had vice been so impudently
paraded; never before had impiety worked such woe in men's
consciences.</p>

<p>'Don't talk to me of your Empire!' he ended by crying;
'it is the bastard son of the Revolution. Oh! we are quite
aware that your Empire dreams of humiliating the Church.
But we are wide awake, and we shall not allow ourselves to
be slaughtered like mere sheep. Just try to ventilate
those doctrines of yours in the Senate, my dear Monsieur
Rougon.'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't talk to him any more,' retorted Clorinde. 'If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
you push him too far, he will spit on the crucifix. He is
doomed.'</p>

<p>Rougon bowed, quite overcome by this onset. Then
there was a fresh pause, while the girl searched on the floor
for the arm that had fallen from the cross. When she had
found it, she carefully wrapt it with the chaplet in a piece of
newspaper. She was growing calmer.</p>

<p>'Ah now, my dear!' M. de Plouguern suddenly exclaimed,
'I haven't told you why I came to see you. I have got a
box at the Palais Royal for this evening, and I'm going to
take you and your mother with me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you dear godfather!' cried Clorinde, turning quite
rosy again with pleasure. 'I'll send to have mother
awakened.'</p>

<p>Then she gave the old man a kiss, by way of reward, she
said; and afterwards turning to Rougon with a smile, and
offering her hand, she said with the sweetest little pout:
'You don't bear me a grudge, do you? Please don't make
me angry again with your pagan talk. I lose my head when
anyone makes fun of religion: I should quarrel with my best
friends over it.'</p>

<p>Luigi had by this time pushed his easel into a corner,
having lost all hope of getting the ear finished that day.
He took up his hat, and tapped the girl on the shoulder to
apprize her of his departure. She accompanied him on to
the landing, closing the door behind her as she left the room.
However, they took leave of one another very noisily, for a
slight scream of Clorinde's rang out, drowned in a burst of
smothered laughter. When she returned to the room, she
said: 'I'll go to dress now, unless my godfather would like
to take me to the Palais Royal as I am.'</p>

<p>They all laughed at the notion. It was now dusk.
When Rougon took his leave, Clorinde went downstairs with
him, leaving M. de Plouguern by himself while she went to
dress. It was already dark on the staircase as Clorinde
descended it in front of Rougon without speaking a word,
and so slowly that he felt the rustle of her gauze costume.
When she reached the door of her bedroom she took a step
or two forward before turning round. Rougon had followed
her to the threshold. 'You won't bear me a grudge, will
you?' she repeated in a low tone, again offering him her
hands.</p>

<p>He assured her that he would not; but as he once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
took hold of her hands his grip was so rough, so threatening
almost, that Clorinde made all haste to escape from him, and
while he stood panting there he heard her calling through an
inner door which had been left open: 'Antonia, bring a light
and get me my grey dress.'</p>

<p>When Rougon reached the avenue of the Champs Élysées
he felt dazed, and stood still for a moment to inhale the fresh
breeze which was blowing down from the Arc de Triomphe.
The gas-lamps of the avenue, where now not a vehicle remained,
were being lighted one by one, spangling the darkness
with a trail of vivid sparks. Rougon felt as if he had
just had an apoplectic fit, and rubbed his face with his hands.</p>

<p>'Ah, no!' he suddenly exclaimed aloud, 'no, no—it
would be too foolish!'</p>



<hr class="chap">
<h3><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a></h3>

<h3>AN IMPERIAL CHRISTENING</h3>


<p>The baptismal procession was to start from the Pavillon de
l'Horloge—the central pavilion of the Tuileries palace—at
five o'clock. It was to wend its way along the main avenue
of the Tuileries gardens, the Place de la Concorde, the Rue de
Rivoli, the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, the Arcole bridge, the
Rue d'Arcole and the Place du Parvis.</p>

<p>By four o'clock there was an immense crowd assembled
near the Arcole bridge. There, in the breach which the river
made in the midst of the city, a whole people could find
accommodation. The view expanded, with the Ile Saint
Louis in the distance barred by the black line of the Louis-Philippe
bridge. The narrow arm of the Seine on the left
vanished amid a mass of low buildings; while the broader
one on the right afforded a far-reaching prospect bathed in
purplish vapour, through which the trees of the Port aux
Vins showed in a green patch. On both sides of the river,
from the Quai Saint Paul to the Quai de la Mégisserie, from
the Quai Napoléon to the Quai de l'Horloge, were long foot-pavements
and roadways; while, in front of the bridge, the
Place de l'Hôtel de Ville afforded a large, open, level space.
And over all the wide expanse, the sky, a bright, warm June
sky, spread a vault of blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>When the half hour struck, there were people everywhere.
All along the footways endless lines of eager spectators were
pressed against the quay parapets. A sea of human heads,
which was continually surging, filled the Place de l'Hôtel de
Ville. Opposite, in the dark gaps of the open windows of the
old houses on the Quai Napoléon, faces were thickly crowding,
and even in the gloomy alleys leading to the river, the Rue
Colombe, the Rue Saint Landry and the Rue Glatigny,
women's caps, with ribbons streaming in the breeze, could be
seen leaning forward. The bridge of Notre Dame displayed
a serried row of sight-seers, whose elbows rested on the
stone parapet, as on the balustrade of some colossal balcony.
Further down, the Louis Philippe bridge swarmed with little
black figures; and even the most distant windows streaking
the grey and yellow house-fronts were every now and then
brightened by some gay dress. There were men on the roofs
among the chimney stacks. People, who could not be distinguished,
were looking through telescopes from their terraces
on the Quai de la Tournelle. And the sunlight spreading
over all seemed like the very quiver of the crowd; it bore afar
the laughter of those surging heads, while gay, mirror-like
parasols reflected the glow, showing as planets amidst all the
medley of skirts and coats.</p>

<p>But there was one thing that was visible from every side,
from the quays and bridges and windows, and that was a
fresco painting of a colossal grey overcoat on the blank wall
of a six-storeyed house on the isle of St. Louis. The sleeve
of this coat was bent at the elbow as though the garment still
retained the shape and attitude of a body that had disappeared
from within it. In the bright sunshine, above all the swarming
sight-seers, this gigantic advertisement presented a most conspicuous
appearance.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>A double line of troops kept the roadway clear for the
procession. National Guards were drawn up on the right
hand, and infantrymen of the Line on the left. At one end,
this military cordon extended to the Rue d'Arcole, which was
gaudy with banners, while from the windows hung costly
draperies which flapped languidly against the dingy house-fronts.
The bridge, to which the crowd had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
admitted, was the only clear spot amidst the general invasion,
and it presented a strange appearance, thus deserted. But,
lower down, on the river banks, the crowding began again.
Shopkeepers in Sunday clothes had spread out their pocket-handkerchiefs
and seated themselves beside their wives to
rest after a whole afternoon of lounging idleness. On the
other side of the bridge, where the river expanded, showing a
deep blue shot with green just where its arms united, there
were some boatmen in red jackets who were working their
oars to keep their boat on a level with the Port aux Fruits.
By the Quai de Gèvres, too, there was a floating laundry, with
wooden walls green with moisture, in which washerwomen
could be heard laughing and beating their clothes. And all
the teeming sight-seers, numbering from three to four hundred
thousand people, now and again raised their heads to glance
at the towers of Notre Dame which rose up square and massive
above the houses of the Quai Napoléon. Gilded by the
declining sun, so that they looked ruddy against the clear sky,
the towers resounded with the clanging peals of their bells,
which sent a quiver through the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Three or four false alarms had already caused a great deal
of jostling in the crowd.</p>

<p>'I tell you that they won't pass before half-past five,' said
a tall fellow who was sitting in front of a café on the Quai de
Gèvres with M. and Madame Charbonnel.</p>

<p>It was Gilquin, Théodore Gilquin, Madame Mélanie
Correur's old lodger, and Rougon's redoubtable friend. He
was dressed that day in a complete suit of yellow duck, a
cheap ready-made line, stained and creased, and here and there
unsewn at the seams. His boots, too, were split, and his straw
hat lacked a ribbon. However, he wore tan coloured gloves,
and for that reason considered that he was in full dress. He
had been acting since noon as a guide to the Charbonnels,
whose acquaintance he had made one evening in the kitchen
at Rougon's house.</p>

<p>'You shall see everything, my children,' he said to them,
as he brushed aside the long black moustaches which swept
across his tipsy-looking face. 'You have put yourselves in
my hands, haven't you? Very well, then let me manage our
little holiday.'</p>

<p>Gilquin had already drunk three nips of brandy and five
glasses of beer. For the last two hours he had been keeping
the Charbonnels prisoners at the café, whither he had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
them, on the pretext that it was absolutely necessary to be
in good time. It was a little café with which he was well
acquainted, and where they would be very comfortable, he
assured them, and he seemed to be on most familiar terms with
the waiter. The Charbonnels had resigned themselves to
their fate, and listened to his talk, feeling much surprised at
its abundance and variety. Madame Charbonnel had declined
to take anything beyond a glass of <i>eau sucrée</i>, and M.
Charbonnel had ordered for himself a glass of anisette, such
as he occasionally indulged in at the Commercial Club at
Plassans. Meanwhile Gilquin discoursed to them about the
Baptism as explicitly as though he had spent the morning at
the Tuileries for the purpose of acquiring information.</p>

<p>'The Empress is in very high spirits,' he said. 'She got
over her delivery splendidly. She's a fine woman! You will
see by-and-bye what a figure she has. The Emperor got back
from Nantes on the day before yesterday. He went there on
account of the floods. What a dreadful calamity those floods
are!'</p>

<p>Madame Charbonnel pushed her chair back. She was
beginning to feel rather afraid of the crowd which was streaming
past her in increasing numbers. 'What a lot of people!'
she muttered.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' cried Gilquin, 'I should think so. There
are more than three hundred thousand visitors in Paris. Excursion
trains have been bringing them here for the last week
from all parts of the country. See, over yonder there are
some people from Normandy, and there are some from
Gascony, and some from Franche-Comté. I can spot them at
once; I've knocked about a good deal in my time.'</p>

<p>He next told them that the courts and the Bourse were
closed, and that all the clerks in the government offices had
got a holiday. The whole capital was holding festival in
honour of the Baptism. Then he began to quote figures, and
calculate what the ceremony and rejoicings would cost. The
Corps Législatif had voted 400,000 francs,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but that was a
mere nothing, for a groom at the Tuileries had informed him
that the procession alone would cost nearly 200,000. If the
Emperor got off with a million from the civil list, he might
think himself lucky. The layette alone had cost 100,000
francs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>'What, 100,000 francs!' cried Madame Charbonnel in
amazement. 'Why, how can they have possibly spent all
that? What can it have gone in?'</p>

<p>Gilquin laughed as he told her that some laces cost an
enormous sum. He himself had travelled in the lace business
in former days. Then he went on with his calculations:
50,000 francs had gone to the parents of children who had
been born on the same day as the little prince, and of whom
the Emperor and Empress had expressed their intention to be
godfather and godmother respectively. Then 85,000 francs
were to be spent in purchasing medals for the authors of the
cantatas which were sung at the theatres. Finally, there were
120,000 commemorative medals distributed among the collegians,
the pupils of the primary schools and asylums and the
non-commissioned officers and privates of the army of Paris. He
had got one of those medals himself, and showed it to them.
It was about the size of a half-franc piece, and bore on one
side the profiles of the Emperor and Empress, and on the
other that of the Prince Imperial, with the date of the latter's
baptism, namely, June 14, 1856.</p>

<p>'Would you mind selling it me?' M. Charbonnel inquired
of Gilquin.</p>

<p>The other expressed his willingness to do so, but as
Charbonnel, embarrassed as to what he should offer for it,
handed him a twenty-sous-piece, he declined it, saying that
the medal was not worth more than ten sous. Madame
Charbonnel, meanwhile, was gazing at the profiles of the
imperial couple, and seemed quite affected by emotion: 'How
good they look!' she said. 'There they are, side by side,
like an affectionate pair. See, Monsieur Charbonnel, you
would say two heads lying on the same pillow when you look
at them this way.'</p>

<p>Then Gilquin returned to the subject of the Empress, of
whose charitable disposition he spoke in the most laudatory
terms. But a short time before her delivery she had devoted
whole afternoons to furthering the establishment of an educational
institute for poor girls in the Faubourg Saint Antoine.
Moreover, she had just refused to accept an offering of 80,000
francs which had been collected in sums of five sous amongst
the poorer classes for the purpose of buying a present for the
young prince; and by her express desire the money was to be
devoted to the apprenticing of a hundred poor orphans.
Gilquin, who was already somewhat tipsy, twisted his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
about in the most dreadful manner as he sought for tender
phrases and expressions which should combine the respect of
the subject with the passionate admiration of the man. He
declared that he would gladly offer up his life in sacrifice at
the feet of that noble woman. And nobody protested against
this. The murmur of the crowd seemed indeed like a distant
echo of his praises. It was now growing into a continuous
clamour, while over the house-tops from the bells of Notre
Dame rolled peal on peal of clanging, tumultuous joy.</p>

<p>'Don't you think it time for us to go and take our places?'
timidly suggested M. Charbonnel, who felt tired of sitting
still.</p>

<p>At this Madame Charbonnel rose up and fastened her
yellow shawl about her neck. 'Yes, I'm sure it is,' she said.
'You wanted to be there in good time, and we're sitting here
and letting everyone go past us.'</p>

<p>Gilquin, however, became indignant; and, with an oath,
brought his fist down on the little zinc table. Didn't he
know all about Paris? he asked; and then, as Madame
Charbonnel timidly dropped upon her chair again, he cried to
the waiter: 'Jules, a glass of absinthe and some cigars!'</p>

<p>But as soon as he had dipped his big moustaches in the
absinthe, he angrily called the waiter back again. 'Are you
having a game with me? Just take this filth away, and give
me some out of the other bottle; the same as I had on Friday.
I have travelled in the liquor-trade, my fine fellow. You
can't bamboozle me.'</p>

<p>He calmed down, however, when the waiter, who seemed
afraid of him, had brought the other bottle, and then he
tapped the Charbonnels on the shoulders, and called them
'old fellow' and 'old lady.' 'Ah! so you're itching to be on
the move, are you, old lady?' said he. 'You'll have plenty
of use for your feet between now and to-night, so you needn't
be in a hurry. We're very comfortable at this café; don't
you think so, old fellow? We can take our ease and watch
the people go by. We've plenty of time, I assure you, so
you'd better order something else.'</p>

<p>'Thank you, we've had all that we want,' said M. Charbonnel.</p>

<p>Gilquin had just lighted a cigar. He leaned back in his
chair, inserted his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat,
thrust out his chest, and began to rock himself backwards
and forwards. His eyes glowed with an expression of perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
content. Suddenly an idea seemed to strike him. 'I'll tell
you what,' he cried; 'I'll call for you at seven o'clock
to-morrow morning, and take you off with me and show you
all the festivities. We'll have a splendid day of it.'</p>

<p>The Charbonnels looked at each other very uneasily. But
Gilquin proceeded to explain his programme after the manner
of a strolling showman. In the morning they would lunch
at the Palais Royal, and walk about the city. In the afternoon
they would go to the Esplanade of the Invalides, where
there would be military performances, greasy poles, three
hundred balloons laden with packets of sweets, and one large
balloon raining down sugared almonds. In the evening they
would dine at a wineshop which he knew of, on the Quai de
Billy; then they would see the fireworks, the principal set-piece
of which would represent a baptistery, and afterwards
they could stroll among the illuminations. And he also told
them of a fiery cross which was to be fixed on the Hôtel de la
Légion d'Honneur; of a fairy palace on the Place de la
Concorde, in the building of which 950,000 pieces of coloured
glass had been used; and of the image atop of the tower of
Saint Jacques, which would look like a blazing torch in mid-air.</p>

<p>As the Charbonnels still hesitated, however, he leaned
towards them and added in lower tones: 'And then, as we come
back, we might look in at a creamery in the Rue de Seine
where they give you such stunning onion soup with cheese.'</p>

<p>At this the Charbonnels no longer dared to refuse. Childish
curiosity and alarm mingled in the expression of their
dilated eyes. They felt that they could not escape from that
terrible man, and must do whatever he told them. Madame
Charbonnel simply murmured: 'Oh! this Paris! this Paris!
Well, well, since we are here, I suppose we must see all that
there is to be seen. But if you only knew, Monsieur Gilquin,
how quiet we were at Plassans! I have a store-room full of
preserves and brandied cherries and pickles which are all
mouldering away!'</p>

<p>'Don't alarm yourself, old lady,' replied Gilquin, who was
growing more and more familiar; 'when you gain your case,
you can ask me to come and stay with you, and then we'll all
have a go at the jam-pots!'</p>

<p>So saying, he poured himself out another glass of absinthe.
He was now perfectly tipsy. For a moment he looked at
the Charbonnels with loving affection; but, all at once, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
sprang to his feet and waved his long arms while calling;
'Eh! eh! Hallo! you there!'</p>

<p>Madame Mélanie Correur, arrayed in a dress of dove-coloured
silk, was just then passing on the opposite footwalk.
She turned her head and seemed extremely annoyed at seeing
Gilquin. However, she crossed over with the majestic gait of
a princess, but on reaching the table required a deal of pressing
before she would accept any refreshment.</p>

<p>'Come now,' cried Gilquin, 'have a little glass of blackcurrant
brandy. I know you like it. You haven't forgotten
the Rue Vanneau, eh? We used to have fine times then,
didn't we? Ah! that big old stupid of a Correur!'</p>

<p>Just as Madame Correur was at last sitting down, a loud
shouting was heard among the crowd. The promenaders
scuttled off like sheep, as though swept along by a gust of
wind. The Charbonnels had instinctively risen with the idea
of following the others, but Gilquin's heavy hand brought
them to their chairs again. His face was quite purple.</p>

<p>'Just keep still and wait for orders, will you?' said he.
'Those folks are making fools of themselves. It is only five
o'clock, isn't it? Well, then, it's the Cardinal-Legate who's
coming; and we don't want to see the Cardinal-Legate, do
we? For my part, I think it's very neglectful of the Pope not
to have come himself. When a man is a godfather he ought
to behave as such, it seems to me. However, I tell you that
the youngster won't be here for another half-hour.'</p>

<p>His intoxication was rapidly depriving him of all sense of
decorum. He had cocked his chair back and begun to smoke
in people's faces, winking the while at the women and glaring
defiantly at the men. A few yards away, near the bridge of
Notre Dame, there was now a block in the road traffic.
Horses were pawing the ground with impatience, and the
uniforms of high functionaries and officers, embroidered with
gold and glittering with decorations, appeared at the windows
of the passing carriages.</p>

<p>'There's a nice show of tinsel and pewter!' sneered
Gilquin, with the smile of a man who cares nothing for gew-gaws.</p>

<p>However, as a brougham came along from the Quai de la
Mégisserie, he almost upset the table as he sprang up and
cried: 'Hallo, Rougon!'</p>

<p>He saluted the great man with his gloved hand, and then,
fearing that he had not been recognised, snatched off his straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
hat and began to wave it. At this, Rougon, whose senatorial
uniform was attracting a deal of notice, quickly withdrew
to a corner of his brougham. And thereupon Gilquin began
to call him, raising his hand to his mouth and using it as a
speaking-trumpet. The people on the footway stopped and
turned to see what was the matter with this strange-looking
fellow dressed in yellow duck. At last, however, the coachman
was able to urge his horse forward, and the brougham
turned on to the bridge of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>'Do be quiet!' said Madame Correur in a low voice, while
catching hold of Gilquin's arms.</p>

<p>But he would not at once sit down again. He remained
on tip-toes, watching the brougham as it mingled with the
other carriages, and at last he hurled a parting shout after
the fleeing wheels: 'Ah! the turn-tail! just because he
wears gold lace on his coat now! All the same, my fat
fellow, you were deucedly hard up once upon a time!'</p>

<p>Some middle-class citizens and their wives who were
sitting at the seven or eight tables of the little café heard
this and opened their eyes in astonishment. At one table
there was a family, consisting of the father and mother and
three children, who seemed profoundly interested in Gilquin's
proceedings. The latter puffed himself out, quite delighted to
find that he had an audience. He let his eyes travel round
the customers of the café, and said in a loud voice as he
dropped into his seat again: 'Rougon! why it was I who
made him what he is!'</p>

<p>Then turning to Madame Correur, who was trying to
quiet him, he appealed to her for corroboration. She knew
that he was speaking the truth, he proclaimed. It had all
happened at the Hôtel Vanneau in the Rue Vanneau. She
surely wouldn't deny that he had lent Rougon his boots a
score of times to enable him to go to the houses of highly-placed
people and mix in a lot of mysterious goings-on.
Why, in those days Rougon only possessed an old pair of
split shoes, which a rag-picker wouldn't have taken as a gift.
Then with a triumphant air Gilquin bent towards the family
at the next table, and exclaimed: 'Oh, she won't confess it,
but it was she who paid for his first pair of new boots in
Paris.'</p>

<p>Madame Correur, however, turned her chair round, so
that she might no longer seem to be one of Gilquin's party.
The Charbonnels had become quite pale at hearing the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
who was to put half a million francs in their pockets spoken
of in such a fashion. Gilquin, however, was wound up, and
rattled off innumerable stories of Rougon's early days. He,
Gilquin, claimed to be a philosopher, and he began to laugh,
and accosted the parties at the different tables one after
another, smoking, spitting, and drinking, while telling them
that he was quite accustomed to the ingratitude of mankind,
and was satisfied with preserving his own self-respect. And
he repeated that he himself had been the making of Rougon.
At that time, he said, he had been a traveller in the perfumery
line, but the Republic was bad for trade. Both he
and Rougon had been living on the same floor in a state of
starvation. Then he was struck with the idea of getting
Rougon to send for some olive-oil from a producer at
Plassans, and they had both wandered about Paris in
different directions till ten o'clock at night with samples of
olive-oil in their pockets. Rougon was not clever at the
business, but he occasionally succeeded in getting some good
orders from the fine folks to whose houses he went in the
evenings.</p>

<p>Ah! that rascal Rougon, he was a bigger booby than a
goose in most things, yet all the same he was very cunning.
A little later, how he had made him, Gilquin, run about to
further his politics! Here Gilquin lowered his voice a little
and winked, and let them know that he himself had belonged
to the Bonapartist band. He had haunted the low dancing-rooms
crying out 'Long live the Republic'; for it was
necessary to profess Republicanism to get influence over the
people. The Empire certainly owed him a big debt for what
he had done; but it hadn't even thanked him. No, while
Rougon and his clique shared all the prizes, he was turned
out of doors like a mangy dog. Well, on the whole, he
preferred that it should be so, he would rather remain independent.
He had only one regret now, and that was that he
had not stuck to the Republicans and made an end of all this
scum with his musket.</p>

<p>'It's just the same, too, with little Du Poizat,' he said in
conclusion. 'He pretends not to know me now; a skinny
little beggar to whom I've often given a pipe of tobacco!
And yet he's a sub-prefect now! Why I've often seen him
with big Amélie, who used to box his ears and kick him
outside the door when he didn't behave properly.'</p>

<p>After this he became silent for a moment as if overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
by tender recollections amidst his maudlin fit. Then, glancing
round at his audience, he began again.</p>

<p>'Well, you've just seen Rougon. I'm as tall a man as he
is, and I'm the same age, and I flatter myself that I've got a
better looking head on my shoulders. Well, now, don't you
think that it would be much better for everyone if I were in
that carriage instead of that great fat pig, with his body
covered all over with gold lace?'</p>

<p>However, just at this moment such a shouting arose on
the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, that the people at the café
became much too excited to reply. The crowd made another
rush; men's legs flew along, while women caught up their
petticoats to enable themselves to run the faster. As the
shouting came nearer and grew more distinct, Gilquin
cried out:</p>

<p>'Ah! here comes the youngster! Hurry up and pay the
score, old man, and then follow me all of you!'</p>

<p>Madame Correur grasped his yellow duck coat so as not
to lose him, and Madame Charbonnel panted along close
behind, while her husband was almost lost in the crowd.
Gilquin, by much resolute pushing, managed to open a
passage through the dense throng, making such a show of
authority that people drew back even at the most crowded
parts. When he at last reached the quay, he lifted the
ladies with an effort, and seated them on the parapet, with
their legs dangling over, on the water side, and this in spite
of their little shrieks of alarm. He himself and M. Charbonnel
remained standing behind.</p>

<p>'Well, my little dears, you're in the front boxes now,' he
said, to reassure the women; 'don't be frightened, we'll take
hold of your waists.'</p>

<p>Thereupon he slipped both arms round Madame Correur's
plump figure. She smiled at him. It was impossible to get
angry with such a jovial fellow. As yet, however, they could
see nothing. The Place de l'Hôtel de Ville was full of
surging heads, and echoed with continuous cheering. Hats
were waving in the distance, held aloft by hands which were
indistinguishable, and forming a huge black billow which
slowly rolled nearer and nearer. Then the occupants of the
houses on the Quai Napoléon, which fronted the Place, began
to show signs of excitement. They leant out of the windows,
crowding against each other, with beaming faces, and arms
outstretched to call attention to something in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of the Rue de Rivoli. For three minutes, which seemed very
long, however, the bridge still remained empty. The bells of
Notre Dame were ringing louder than ever, as though in some
wild fit of joyful excitement.</p>

<p>Suddenly the anxious multitude beheld a company of
trumpeters upon the empty bridge. There was a great sigh
of expectation. Behind the trumpeters and the mounted
band which followed them, came a general, escorted by his
staff. Then, behind squadrons of carabineers, dragoons and
hussars, followed the state-carriages. There were eight of
them, each drawn by six horses. In those that came first sat
the ladies-in-waiting, the chamberlains, the officers of the
household of the Emperor and Empress, and the ladies in
attendance upon the Grand Duchess of Baden, who had been
deputed to represent the young prince's godmother. Gilquin,
without letting go his hold of Madame Correur, told her from
behind that the godmother, the Queen of Sweden, had not
put herself out any more than the godfather had done. Then,
as the seventh and eighth carriages went past, he told her the
names of those who occupied them, with a glibness which
bespoke great familiarity with court matters. Those two
ladies, he said, were the Princess Mathilde and the Princess
Marie. Those three gentlemen were King Jérôme, Prince
Napoleon and the Crown Prince of Sweden. The lady with
them was the Grand Duchess of Baden. Meanwhile, the
procession swept on slowly. The equerries and aides-de-camp
and gentlemen-in-waiting all rode with short reins to keep
their horses at a walk.</p>

<p>'But where is the baby?' asked Madame Charbonnel impatiently.</p>

<p>'Oh! don't be frightened,' said Gilquin, with a laugh;
'they haven't put him under a seat. Wait a little and you'll
see him.'</p>

<p>So saying, he tightened his grasp round Madame Correur,
who allowed him to do so, she explained, because she was
afraid of slipping into the water. Then, growing enthusiastic
over the display, he continued, while his eyes glistened
brightly: 'Isn't it really splendid? See how they take their
ease, the rascals, in their satin-quilted coaches! And to
think that I worked for all this!'</p>

<p>Then he began to puff himself out as though the procession,
the crowd and everything that was to be seen owed their
origin to him. However, after the temporary lull, caused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the appearance of the first carriages, there came a tremendous
uproar. It was upon the quay itself now that hats were
waving over the surging heads of the crowd. Six imperial
outriders, wearing green liveries and round caps, from which
dangled large gold tassels, had made their appearance on the
bridge. Then at last the Empress's carriage came in sight.
It was drawn by eight horses; and at each of its four corners
there was a magnificent lamp. Large and rounded, panelled
almost entirely with glass, this coach resembled a huge
crystal casket with gold settings, mounted upon golden wheels.
Inside it, amidst a cloud of snowy lace, one could clearly distinguish
the rosy face of the Prince Imperial, carried upon the
knees of the Governess of the Children of France, by whose
side sat the wet nurse, a young, handsome, and buxom Burgundian.
Then a short distance behind, following a group of
mounted equerries and grooms on foot, came the Emperor's
carriage, which also was drawn by eight horses, and was as
magnificent as the previous one. In it sat the Emperor and
Empress, who bowed to the people as they passed. Beside
these two last carriages rode several marshals of France, who,
without sign of impatience, let all the dust from the wheels
settle on their richly broidered uniforms.</p>

<p>'Just fancy if the bridge were to break down!' exclaimed
Gilquin with a grin. He was fond of indulging in the most
awful suppositions.</p>

<p>Madame Correur, frightened at the thought of such a
thing, tried to stop him, but he would dwell on the subject,
remarking that iron bridges were never safe. He even
asserted that he could see the platform oscillating when the
two carriages were but half-way across. What a splash, he
continued; if papa and mamma and baby went down they
would get such a drink as would keep them from ever wanting
another! The carriages, however, rolled softly and silently
over the bridge, and the frame-work of the gently-curving
arch was so light that they looked almost as though suspended
in space over the river, in whose blue depths they were
reflected like strange gold-fishes, carried up by the flow of the
tide. The Emperor and Empress, feeling a little tired,
leaned back against the buttoned satin, glad to escape the
crowd for a moment and the necessity of bowing to it. The
Governess, too, took advantage of the stretch of empty space
to raise the little prince, who was slipping from her knees,
while the nurse, leaning forward, amused him with a smile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
The whole procession was steeped in bright sunshine. The
uniforms, the gay gowns, and the horse-trappings shone
out brilliantly, while the sparkling planet-like coaches cast
tremulous beams of reflected sunlight along the fronts of the
dingy houses on the Quai Napoléon. In the distance, above
the bridge, the colossal advertisement of the giant grey overcoat,
painted on the wall of a six-storeyed house, and now
illumined with radiant splendour by the sun, formed a sort
of background to the magnificent picture.</p>

<p>Gilquin noticed the overcoat just as it towered above the
two carriages. 'Look!' he cried, 'there's the uncle<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> over
yonder!'</p>

<p>A laugh ran through the surrounding crowd. M. Charbonnel,
who did not catch the point, wanted to have it explained
to him, but his request was drowned by the deafening
cheering and clapping of hands that arose from the three
hundred thousand people there pressed together. A mighty
thrill of enthusiasm had sped through the mass of sight-seers
as the little prince, followed by the Emperor and Empress,
came into sight on the middle of the bridge, of which they
had a full, unbroken view. Men rose on tip-toe, and set their
dazed youngsters astride their necks, while women wept or
stammered out expressions of love for 'the little darling,'
showing a heartfelt sympathy with the happiness of the
imperial parents. A storm of shouts still rolled on from the
Place de l'Hôtel de Ville; and upon the quays, both up and
down the river, there was a forest of waving, outstretched
arms. Handkerchiefs fluttered from the windows, and men
and women craned forward with glistening eyes and gaping
mouths. Away in the distance the windows of the Ile Saint
Louis, which looked like narrow streaks of charcoal, were
lighted up with white gleams and evidences of life too far
away to be clearly distinguished. However, the boatmen in
red jackets stood up in the middle of the river, where the current
swept them along, and shouted their loudest, while the
washerwomen, leaning out of the windows of the floating
laundry, waved their bare arms excitedly, and, in their desire
to be heard, dealt blow after blow with their beetles till they
nearly broke them.</p>

<p>'There, it's all over!' exclaimed Gilquin; 'let us be off.'</p>

<p>The Charbonnels, however, wanted to see the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
everything. The tail of the procession—squadrons of Cent
Gardes, cuirassiers and carabineers—was plunging into the
Rue d'Arcole. Then there came a scene of dreadful confusion.
In several places people broke through the double
line of National Guards and regulars, and women began to
scream.</p>

<p>'Come along! come along!' repeated Gilquin. 'We
shall be crushed to death!'</p>

<p>When he had deposited the ladies on the footway, he
made them cross the road in spite of the crowd. Madame
Correur and the Charbonnels had wanted to keep near the
parapet, so as to make their way to the bridge of Notre Dame
and see what was happening on the Place du Parvis. But
Gilquin would not hear of it, and dragged them after him.
When they once more reached the little café, he gave them a
push and made them sit down again at the table which they
had recently left.</p>

<p>'What perverse creatures you are!' he cried. 'Do you
suppose that I want to have my feet crushed by all those
louts? We'll have something to drink, we will! We are
much better off here than in that crush. We've had enough
sight-seeing. It was beginning to get wearisome. Come, old
lady, what will you drink?'</p>

<p>The Charbonnels, upon whom he kept his perturbing eyes,
began to make timid objections. They would have liked to
see the procession leave the church. But Gilquin assured
them that it would be best to give the crowd time to disperse,
and that he would take them to the church in a quarter of an
hour, if the crush was not too thick. However, while he was
telling Jules to bring a supply of cigars and beer, Madame
Correur prudently made her escape. 'Well, stay and rest
yourselves a little,' she said to the Charbonnels. 'You will
find me over yonder by-and-bye.'</p>

<p>She made her way to the bridge of Notre Dame and then
into the Rue de la Cité. But the crush there was still so
great that it took her a good quarter of an hour to reach the
Rue de Constantine. At last she made a cut through the
Rue de la Licorne and the Rue des Trois Canettes, and in this
way emerged upon the Place du Parvis, after losing at the
ventilator of a suspicious house one of the flounces of her
dove-coloured dress. Round the square, strewn with sand
and flowers, stood tall masts, from which hung banners bearing
the imperial arms. In front of the church a vast tent-shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
porch draped the stone-work with curtains of crimson velvet,
having fringes and tassels of gold.</p>

<p>Here Madame Correur was checked by a body of troops
who kept back the crowd. In the middle of the space from
which the public had been excluded, footmen were pacing up
and down beside the carriages, which were drawn up in five
rows, their coachmen still occupying their seats and holding
their reins. As Madame Correur craned her head forward in
the hope of finding some gap through which she might pass,
she caught sight of Du Poizat quietly smoking a cigar in a
corner of the square among some of the footmen.</p>

<p>'Don't you think you could get me in?' she asked him,
when she had attracted his attention by waving her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Du Poizat went and spoke to an officer, and then led
Madame Correur in front of the church.</p>

<p>'If you'll take my advice,' he said to her, 'you'll stay here
with me. It's perfectly packed inside. I was nearly suffocated
myself, and so I came out. See, there are Colonel
Jobelin and Monsieur Bouchard, who have given up all hope
of finding room.'</p>

<p>She looked and saw the two men on her left, near the
Rue du Cloître Notre Dame. M. Bouchard was saying that
he had just left his wife in charge of M. d'Escorailles, who
had an excellent seat for a lady at his disposal, while the
colonel's chief regret seemed to be that he was not able to
explain the ceremony to his son Auguste.</p>

<p>'I much wished to show him the famous vase,' he said.
'It is, as you know, the genuine vase of Saint Louis—a vase
of copper, damascened and ornamented with niello work in the
most perfect Persian manner. It is a relic of the times of
the Crusades, and has been used at the christenings of all our
kings ever since.'</p>

<p>'Did you see all the insignia?' M. Bouchard asked Du
Poizat.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied the latter. 'Madame de Llorentz was
carrying the chrisom.'</p>

<p>Then he entered into details. The chrisom was the
christening cloth, a fact of which neither of the men had
been aware. But Du Poizat went on to enumerate, not only
the insignia of the Prince Imperial, the chrisom, the candle
and the salt-cellar, but the insignia of the godfather and godmother,
the basin, the ewer and the towel, all of which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
carried by ladies-in-waiting. Then there was also the little
prince's mantle, a most magnificent and wonderful mantle,
which was hung over an arm-chair near the font.</p>

<p>'Isn't there really the smallest corner where I could
squeeze myself?' cried Madame Correur, in whom all these
details had roused a fever of curiosity.</p>

<p>Then they told her of all the great state bodies and high
officials and innumerable deputations that they had seen pass.
It was an almost endless procession, they said; the Diplomatic
body, the Senate, the Corps Législatif, the Council of
State, the Supreme Court, the Exchequer Court, the Appeal
Court, the Tribunals of Commerce and of First Instance; to
say nothing of the ministers, the prefects, the mayors and
their deputies, the academicians, the general officers, and a
host of others, including even delegates from the Jewish and
Protestant consistories.</p>

<p>'Oh! what a splendid sight it must be!' Madame Correur
exclaimed with a sigh.</p>

<p>Du Poizat shrugged his shoulders. He was in a very bad
humour. All those people bored him, he said, and he seemed
irritated by the length of the ceremony. How much longer
would they be? They had sung the <i>Veni Creator</i> and had
censed themselves and walked about and saluted one another.
Surely the child must be christened by this time!</p>

<p>Meanwhile M. Bouchard and the colonel manifested
greater patience and examined the decorated windows of the
square; then, as a sudden peal of the bells shook the towers,
they turned their heads and quivered uneasily at their close
proximity to the huge church, whose summit they could not
even discern in the sky. However, Auguste had slipped
towards the porch, whither Madame Correur followed him.
But when she reached the great door, which was wide open,
the magnificent sight she beheld kept her rooted to the
ground.</p>

<p>Between the two great curtains of the porch the church
appeared like a vision of some superhuman temple. The
vaulted arches, of a soft blue, were spangled with stars.
Around this wondrous firmament the stained-glass windows
gleamed like mystic planets, sparkling with burning jewels.
From the lofty pillars on all sides hung drapery of crimson
velvet, which still further shut the daylight out of the usually
dim nave; and in the centre of this roseate twilight there
blazed a multitude of tapers—thousands of tapers—so closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
crowded that they seemed like a great sun flaming out amidst
a rain of stars. This blaze was that of the altar, set on a
platform in the centre of the transept. Thrones were placed
on the right and left of it. Over the higher of the two thrones
a spreading canopy of velvet lined with ermine showed like a
huge bird with snowy breast and purple wings. The church
was filled with a glittering crowd, bright with gold and jewels.
Near the altar a group of clergy, bishops with mitres and
croziers, formed, as it were, a glory, one of those dazzling
splendours which suggest heaven itself. Around the altar
princes, princesses and great dignitaries were ranged in
sovereign pomp and circumstance. Then tiers of seats had
been set up in the arms of the transept, for the Diplomatic
body and the Senate, on the right, and for the Corps Législatif
and the Council of State on the left; while representative
bodies of every kind crowded the rest of the nave, and ladies
displayed their bright, variegated gowns in the galleries above.
A sanguineous haze floated over everything. The heads which
showed in tiers on all sides had the roseate hue of painted
porcelain. The dresses, the satin and silk and velvet, glowed
with a dull splendour as though they would soon burst into a
blaze. Rows of people suddenly seemed to flare. The whole
deep church was like some wondrous furnace.</p>

<p>Then Madame Correur saw an assistant master of the
ceremonies advance to the centre of the choir, where he thrice
shouted energetically: 'Long live the Prince Imperial! Long
live the Prince Imperial! Long live the Prince Imperial!'</p>

<p>And as the lofty arches shook with a mighty acclamation,
Madame Correur saw the Emperor standing on the altar steps
overlooking the throng. He stood out black and distinct
against the background of blazing gold which the bishops
formed behind him. He was presenting the Prince Imperial
to the people, holding the infant, who seemed a mere bundle
of white lace, aloft in his upstretched arms.</p>

<p>But a beadle suddenly motioned to Madame Correur to
retire. She took a couple of steps backwards, and the next
moment saw nothing but one of the curtains of the porch.
The vision had disappeared. The bright daylight made her
blink, and for an instant she remained confused, half fancying
that she had been gazing upon some old picture like those in
the Louvre, some picture baked by age, purpled and gilded,
and depicting people of a past-away time, such as one no longer
met in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>'Don't stop there,' Du Poizat said to her, as he led her
back to the colonel and M. Bouchard.</p>

<p>The latter were now discussing the floods, which had
caused terrible destruction in the valleys of the Rhone and the
Loire. Thousands of families had been rendered homeless.
The subscriptions which had been opened on all sides were
insufficient for the relief of such great distress. However, they
asserted that the Emperor had exhibited most admirable
courage and generosity. At Lyons he had been seen fording
the low parts of the inundated city, and at Tours he had spent
three hours rowing in a boat through the submerged streets;
and everywhere he had lavishly distributed alms.</p>

<p>'Ah, listen!' interrupted the colonel.</p>

<p>The organ was now pealing through the church, and a
sonorous chant rolled through the porch, whose curtains swayed
as the great gust of sound swept out.</p>

<p>'It is the <i>Te Deum</i>!' exclaimed M. Bouchard.</p>

<p>Du Poizat heaved a sigh of relief. They were getting to
an end at last! M. Bouchard, however, informed him that
the registers had yet to be signed, and, afterwards, the
Cardinal-Legate would have to give the pontifical benediction.
Some of the congregation were, however, already leaving.
Rougon was one of the first to appear, giving his arm to a
lady of slight build, who had a sallow complexion, and was very
plainly dressed. They were accompanied by a personage who
wore the dress of a president of an Appeal Court.</p>

<p>'Who are those?' asked Madame Correur.</p>

<p>Du Poizat told her their names. M. Beulin-d'Orchère,
the president, had become acquainted with Rougon some time
before the Coup d'État, and had manifested much esteem for
him since that period, without, however, attempting to establish
any close intimacy. Mademoiselle Véronique, his sister,
lived with him in a house in the Rue Garancière, which she
seldom left except to attend low mass at Saint Sulpice.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said the colonel, lowering his voice, 'that is the
wife for Rougon!'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' assented M. Bouchard. 'She has got a suitable
fortune; her family is good, and she is a steady-going
woman of experience. He will never find a wife more fitted
for him.'</p>

<p>Du Poizat, however, protested. The lady, he said, was
as over-ripe as a forgotten medlar. She was at least thirty-six
years of age, and looked forty. A nice broom-handle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
all truth! A devotee with hair brushed smooth and smug!
As faded and as washed-out as though she had been soaking
her head in holy water for the last six months!</p>

<p>'You are young,' rejoined the head-clerk, gravely. 'Rougon
ought to make a sensible marriage. I myself married for love,
but that does not succeed with everyone.'</p>

<p>'Oh! I don't apprehend any danger from the lady herself,'
continued Du Poizat; 'it's Beulin-d'Orchère's look that
alarms me. He's got a regular dog's jaw. Just look at him
with his heavy muzzle and forest of woolly hair, without a
single silver thread in it, in spite of his fifty years. What's
he thinking about, I wonder? Why does he still drive his
sister into Rougon's arms now that our friend is out of
favour?'</p>

<p>M. Bouchard and the colonel kept silent, and exchanged
uneasy glances. Was 'the dog,' as the ex-sub-prefect called
him, going to make Rougon his own prey?</p>

<p>However, Madame Correur slowly opined: 'It is a good
thing to have the judicial bench on one's side.'</p>

<p>Meantime, Rougon was conducting Mademoiselle Véronique
to her carriage, and, before she got into it, he bowed to
her. Just at that moment the fair Clorinde came out of the
church, leaning upon Delestang's arm. She became quite
grave, and cast a fiery glance at that tall sallow creature, the
door of whose carriage Rougon was gallantly closing, notwithstanding
his senatorial uniform. And as soon as the carriage
had gone off, Clorinde dropped Delestang's arm, and stepped
straight up to the great man, breaking out into her old gay
laugh. All the others followed.</p>

<p>'I have lost my mother!' merrily said the girl to Rougon.
'She has been carried off somewhere in the crowd. Will you
give me a little corner in your brougham?'</p>

<p>At this Delestang, who had hoped to take her home,
seemed very much annoyed. She was wearing a dress of
orange silk, brocaded with such showy flowers that the very
footmen stared at her. Rougon had immediately granted her
request, but they had to wait for the brougham for another
ten minutes. And they all remained standing where they
were, even Delestang, though his carriage was in the first
row, only a yard or two away. In the meanwhile the congregation
continued to leave the church. M. Kahn and M. Béjuin,
who were passing, came up and joined the group. And as the
great man shook hands in a listless way, and looked somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
out of sorts, M. Kahn asked with anxious concern: 'Aren't
you feeling well?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' he answered, 'but those lights inside there
rather dazed me.' He remained silent for a moment, and
then continued in a low voice: 'It was a splendid sight. I
never saw such an expression of happiness upon a man's face
before.'</p>

<p>He was referring to the Emperor, and, as he spoke, he
slowly spread out his arms with a sweeping majestic gesture,
as though he were recalling the scene in the church. But he
added not a word, and the others likewise kept silence. They
formed quite a little group in a corner of the square. In
front of them the stream of people leaving the church grew
larger; there were judges in their robes, officers and functionaries
in full uniform, a crowd of belaced and bedizened and
decorated personages who trod over the flowers strewing the
square, amidst the calls of footmen and sudden rolling of
carriage-wheels. The soaring glory of the Empire blazed, as
it were, in the crimson of the setting sun; and the towers of
Notre Dame, all roseate and musical, seemed to attest the
lofty peace and greatness to which the future reign of the
child, baptized beneath their shadow, would some day attain.
But in Rougon's group, the splendour of the ceremony, the
pealing bells, the streaming banners, and the enthusiasm of
the city only aroused feelings of envy and desire. For the
first time Rougon himself felt the chilly weight of the disfavour
into which he had fallen. His face was very pale, and,
as he stood there deep in thought, he envied the Emperor.</p>

<p>'Well, good afternoon; I'm off! I can't stand it any
longer!' exclaimed Du Poizat, shaking hands with the
others.</p>

<p>'What's the matter with you to-day?' asked the colonel,
'you seem very fractious.'</p>

<p>But the sub-prefect quietly replied, as he went away:
'Well, you can scarcely expect me to be in very high spirits.
I saw in the <i>Moniteur</i> this morning that that ass of a
Campenon has been appointed to the prefecture which was
promised to me.'</p>

<p>The others exchanged glances. Du Poizat was quite
right. They had no share in the fête. They were all left
out in the cold. Ever since the birth of the prince, Rougon
had promised them a shower of presents for the day of the
christening. M. Kahn was to have had his railway grant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the colonel was to have had a commander's cross, and
Madame Correur was to have had the five or six tobacco-shops
for which she had asked. And now they were all
huddled there in a corner of the square, empty-handed. At
this thought they cast such a distressful and reproachful look
at Rougon, that the latter shrugged his shoulders furiously.
And as his brougham at last drew up, he hastily pushed
Clorinde inside, got in himself, and closed the door with a
bang, never saying a word.</p>

<p>'There's Marsy under the porch,' muttered M. Kahn,
dragging M. Béjuin on one side. 'How arrogant the rascal
looks! Don't show him your face; it would only give him
the opportunity of cutting us.'</p>

<p>Delestang had hastily got into his carriage in order to
follow Rougon's brougham. M. Bouchard, however, waited
for his wife, and when the church was empty he was surprised
at not seeing her appear; however, he went off with the
colonel, who had grown equally tired of waiting for his son
Auguste. As for Madame Correur, she accepted the escort of
a lieutenant of dragoons, who came from her own part of
France, and who was to some extent indebted to her for his
epaulets.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inside the brougham, Clorinde was prattling
enthusiastically about the ceremony that had just taken place;
while Rougon leaned back with sleepy eyes and listened to
her. She had seen the Easter solemnities at Rome, she told
him, but they were not finer than what she had just beheld.
And she added that, for her, religion lay in a vision of heaven
with God the Father seated on His throne like a glittering
sun amidst the glory of His encircling angels, a host of lovely
youths and maidens. But all at once she broke off to inquire:
'Are you going to the banquet which the city is giving to
their majesties to-night? It will be magnificent.'</p>

<p>She had got an invitation herself, and meant to wear a
pink dress, brocaded with forget-me-nots. M. de Plouguern
was going to take her, as her mother would not go out at
night on account of the headaches to which she was so subject.
However, she suddenly changed her subject again, asking
abruptly: 'Who was that judge you were with just now?'</p>

<p>Rougon raised his head, and said all in a breath: 'Monsieur
Beulin-d'Orchère, fifty years of age, of a legal family,
began as public prosecutor's assessor at Montbrison, was
afterwards public prosecutor at Orleans, advocate-general at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Rouen, a member of a mixed commission in 1852, and then
came to Paris as councillor at the Appeal Court, of which he
is now the president. Oh! I was forgetting; he approved of
the decree of the twenty-second of January, 1852, confiscating
the property of the Orleans family. There, are you satisfied?'</p>

<p>Clorinde began to laugh. He was making fun of her, she
said, just because she asked for information; but there was
nothing foolish—was there?—in asking about people whom
one was liable to meet. She did not say a word about
Mademoiselle Beulin-d'Orchère; but again began to talk of
the banquet at the Hôtel de Ville. The grand gallery would
be decorated with unheard-of magnificence, and a band would
play the whole time the guests were dining. Ah! France
was truly a great country! Nowhere, neither in England,
nor in Germany, nor in Spain, nor in Italy, had she seen such
wonderful balls, such prodigious galas. She had quite made
up her mind now, she said, her face beaming with admiration;
she meant to be a Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>'Oh, look!' she cried; 'there are some soldiers there!'</p>

<p>The brougham, after rolling along the Rue de la Cité,
had now been stopped at the end of the Pont Notre Dame by
a regiment which was marching back to its quarters. It was
one of the line. The soldiers, all of them little fellows, were
hastening on like sheep, their march being somewhat irregular
by reason of the trees planted along the roadside. They had
been keeping the line for the procession; their faces were
scorched by the hot afternoon sun; their feet were white with
dust; and their backs bent beneath the weight of their knapsacks
and rifles. And they had felt so bored amid the jostling
of the crowd that they still looked dazed and stupid.</p>

<p>'I adore the French army,' said Clorinde enthusiastically,
as she leant forward to get a better view.</p>

<p>Rougon roused himself, and in his turn looked out of the
window. It was the power of the Empire that was passing
through the dust. A great many carriages had now gathered
together on the bridge, but the coachmen respectfully waited
for the soldiers to pass, and distinguished personages in gala
costumes smiled sympathisingly at the little fellows who were
so stupefied by their long day's work.</p>

<p>'Do you see those in the rear?' exclaimed Clorinde.
'There's a whole row of them without a hair on their faces.
How nice they look!'</p>

<p>Then, in her enthusiasm, she began to kiss her hands to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the little soldiers from the depths of the brougham. She lay
back a little so that she might not be seen. Rougon smiled
in a paternal manner. He, too, had just felt a thrill of pleasure,
the first he had known during the whole day.</p>

<p>'What's going on here?' he exclaimed, when the
brougham was at last able to turn the corner of the quay.</p>

<p>A considerable crowd had formed on the footway and in
the road, and the brougham had to stop again. A voice in
the throng was heard saying: 'It's a drunken man who has
insulted the soldiers. The police have just taken him into
custody.'</p>

<p>Then, as the crowd parted, Rougon caught sight of
Gilquin, dead-drunk, and held by a couple of policemen.
His yellow duck clothes were torn, and his naked flesh showed
through the rents. But he still retained his garrulous
joviality and scarlet face. He addressed the policemen in the
most familiar fashion, calling them his little lambs. He told
them that he had been quietly spending the afternoon in a
neighbouring café with some very rich people, and referred
them for inquiries to the Palais Royal theatre, where M. and
Madame Charbonnel, who had gone to see <i>Les Dragées du
Baptême</i>, would readily confirm his statement.</p>

<p>'Come, let me go, you jokers!' he cried, suddenly stiffening
himself. 'Confound it all, the café's close at hand;
come with me there, if you don't believe me. The soldiers
insulted me. There was a little scamp who laughed at me,
and I shut him up. But for me to insult the French army!
Never! Just you mention the name of Théodore to the
Emperor and hear what he says. Ah! you're a nice set, you
are!'</p>

<p>The crowd roared with amusement, while the imperturbable
policemen slowly dragged Gilquin towards the Rue Saint
Martin, where the red lamp of a police-station could be seen.
Rougon had hastily thrown himself back in his brougham,
but Gilquin, raising his head, caught sight of him. Then,
drunk though he was, he again became good-natured and
prudent, and casting a glance at Rougon, exclaimed, so that
the latter might hear him: 'Well, well, my friends: I might
get up a scandal if I liked, but I've too much self-respect.
Ah, you wouldn't lay your hands on Théodore in this way if
he drove about with princesses as a citizen of my acquaintance
does. All the same, however, I've worked with great
people, and cleverly, too, though I don't want to boast about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
it, and never asked for a big reward. But I know my own
worth, and that consoles me for other people's meanness.
Ah, confound it, are friends no longer friends, then?'</p>

<p>He spoke with growing emotion, his speech impeded by
hiccoughs, while Rougon quietly beckoned to a man wearing
a closely buttoned coat, whom he saw standing near his
brougham, and, after whispering a few words to him, gave
him Gilquin's address, 17 Rue Virginie, Grenelle. And
thereupon the man—a detective—stepped up to the officers
as though he were about to help them with the drunkard
who had begun to struggle. However, the crowd was greatly
surprised to see the policemen turn to the left and bundle
Gilquin into a cab, whose driver, after receiving an order,
drove away along the Quai de la Mégisserie. Gilquin, however,
thrust his huge unkempt head from the window, and,
with a burst of triumphant laughter, shouted: 'Long live
the Republic!'</p>

<p>When the crowd had dispersed, the quays resumed their
wonted tranquillity. Paris, weary of enthusiasm, had gone
off to dinner. The three hundred thousand sight-seers, who
had struggled and crowded there, were now invading the
restaurants by the water-side and those of the district of the
Temple. None but country cousins paced the deserted pavements,
quite knocked up and at a loss where to dine. Down
below, in the floating laundry the washerwomen were finishing
their work with vigorous blows. A last ray of sunlight
still gilded the towers of Notre Dame, which now rose quite
silent above the houses already dark with shadow. And
through the slight mist ascending from the Seine, nothing
could be distinguished among the grey mass of buildings, on
the Ile Saint Louis, save the giant great-coat, that colossal
advertisement hanging seemingly from some nail on the
horizon, and looking like the garment of a Titan, whose body
had been pulverised by the thunderbolts of Jove.</p>

<h3><a name="V" id="V">V</a></h3>

<h3>PASSION AND MATRIMONY</h3>


<p>One morning towards eleven o'clock, Clorinde called at
Rougon's house in the Rue Marbeuf. She was on her way
back from the Bois, and a groom held her horse at the door.
She went straight into the garden, turned to the left, and
halted in front of the open window of the study in which the
great man sat at work.</p>

<p>'Ah! I've taken you by surprise!' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Rougon quickly raised his head. The girl stood laughing
in the warm June sunshine. Her riding-habit of heavy blue
cloth made her seem taller. She was carrying its long train
over her left arm, and its tight-fitting corsage clung to her
shoulders and breast and hips like skin. She wore linen
wristbands and collar, and a narrow necktie of blue silk,
while atop of her rolled-up hair a tall silk hat was jauntily
perched with a veil of bluish gauze powdered with the golden
dust of the sunlight.</p>

<p>'What, is it you?' cried Rougon, hastening to her.
'Pray come in!'</p>

<p>'No, no,' she answered; 'don't disturb yourself, I have
only a word to say to you. My mother will be expecting me
back to lunch.'</p>

<p>This was the third time that she had come in this way to
Rougon's house in defiance of all propriety. She made a
point, however, of remaining in the garden; and upon the
previous occasions, as upon this one, she had come in her
riding-habit, a costume which seemed to confer masculine
privileges upon her.</p>

<p>'I've come to beg,' she said. 'I want you to buy some
lottery tickets. We are getting up a lottery for the benefit of
some poor girls.'</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed; well, come in,' repeated Rougon, 'you can
tell me all about it.'</p>

<p>She had kept her whip in her hand, a slight delicate whip
with a little silver handle. And on hearing him she again
began to laugh while gently tapping her skirt with her whip.</p>

<p>'Oh, I've told you all there is to tell,' said she. 'You
must take some tickets. That's all I came for. I've been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
looking for you for the last three days without finding you, and
the drawing takes place to-morrow.' Then, as she took a
little case out of her pocket, she inquired: 'How many tickets
would you like?'</p>

<p>'Not one, if you won't come in!' cried Rougon. And he
continued, playfully: 'We can't transact business at the window,
you know, and I'm not going to hand you money out as
though you were some beggar-woman.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't object, as long as I get it.'</p>

<p>But Rougon remained firm. She looked at him for a
moment in silence, and then resumed: 'If I come in, will
you promise to take ten tickets? They are ten francs each.'</p>

<p>However, she did not make up her mind without some
further hesitation, and she even cast a hasty glance round the
garden. There was a gardener on his knees planting a bed
of geraniums. Then she smiled slightly and stepped towards
the little flight of steps upon which the folding-window of the
study opened. Rougon held out his hand and drew her into
the middle of the room.</p>

<p>'Are you afraid that I shall eat you?' he asked her.
'You know very well that I am the most submissive of your
slaves. What are you frightened of?'</p>

<p>'I! I'm not afraid of anything,' she replied again, tapping
her skirts with her whip, which she then laid upon a couch in
order to fumble in her little case once more. 'You'll take
ten, won't you?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I will take twenty, if you wish it,' he replied; 'but do,
please, sit down and let us have a little chat. You surely
don't want to be off at once.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, it shall be a ticket a minute. If I stay a
quarter of an hour, you will have to take fifteen tickets, and if
I stay twenty minutes, you will have to take twenty tickets, and
so on as long as I stay. Is that agreed?'</p>

<p>They laughed merrily over this arrangement, and Clorinde
thereupon seated herself in an easy chair in the very embrasure
of the window which remained open. Rougon, on his
side, resumed his seat at his table in order to put her at her
ease. Then they began to talk, taking the house for their
first subject. Clorinde glanced out of the window and remarked
that the garden was rather small, but very charming,
with its central lawn and clumps of evergreens. Then Rougon
began to describe the house to her. On the ground-floor,
said he, were his study, a large drawing-room, a small one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and a very handsome dining-room. On the first-floor there
were seven bedrooms, and as many on the second. Although
to some people the house might seem a very small one, it was
much too big for him, he declared. At the time when the
Emperor had made him a present of it he had been engaged
to marry a widow, chosen by his Majesty himself; but the
lady had died, and now he intended to remain a bachelor.</p>

<p>'Why?' asked Clorinde, looking him straight in the
face.</p>

<p>'Oh! I've other things to do than to get married. When
a man reaches my age, he no longer thinks about a wife.'</p>

<p>'Don't be so affected,' replied Clorinde, with a shrug of her
shoulders.</p>

<p>They had become intimate enough to talk very freely
together. Clorinde declared that she believed Rougon to be
amorously inclined, but he defended himself, and told her of
his early times, of the years he had spent in bare rooms, which
never a woman entered. Still, she went on questioning him
about his lady-loves with childish curiosity, and he again and
again replied with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>'No! no wife for me!' he cried at last, though his eyes
were glistening at the sight of Clorinde's careless attitude.</p>

<p>A peculiar smile played on the girl's lips as she lay back
in her chair. There was an expression of soft languor on her
face, and her bosom gently heaved. When she replied, it
was with an exaggerated Italian accent, and in a sort of singing
voice. 'Nonsense, my friend; you adore us, I know.
Will you bet me that you aren't married by this time next
year?'</p>

<p>She was really provoking, so certain did she seem to be of
conquering him. For some time past she had been calmly
offering herself to Rougon. She no longer attempted to disguise
her snares and the clever way in which she had worked
upon him before laying siege to his desires. She considered
that he was now sufficiently overcome for her to bring the
matter to an issue. It was a real duel that was going on
between them, and although the conditions of the combat were
not mentioned in actual words, there were unmistakable confessions
in their glances. When they looked at each other
they could not refrain from smiling. Clorinde had set her
eyes upon her goal and went straight towards it, with a
haughty boldness; while Rougon, infatuated though he
was, resolved to play a wily game in order to prove his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
superiority. Their pride was engaged in the struggle quite as
much as their passions were.</p>

<p>'With us in Italy,' resumed Clorinde in a low tone, 'love
is the great business of life. Young girls of twelve already
have their lovers. For myself, I have travelled about so
much, that I've almost become a man. But if you could
only have seen mamma when she was young! She was so
lovely that people came from long distances to see her, but
she seldom if ever left her house. There was a count who
stayed at Milan expressly for six months without catching
sight of her hair even. The fact is, that Italian women are
very different from French women, who are always chattering
and gadding about. An Italian woman remains with the
man she has chosen. But I have travelled so much, that I
really don't know whether I haven't lost that instinct or not;
still I think that I could love very strongly; ah, yes, with all
my heart and soul.'</p>

<p>She had let her eyelids fall, and her face glowed as with a
voluptuous ecstasy. While she was speaking, Rougon had
left his table as though attracted by some force which he
could not withstand, and his hands were trembling. But
when he got near to Clorinde, the girl opened her eyes again
and gave him a quiet glance. Then, as she looked at the
clock, she said with a smile: 'This makes ten tickets.'</p>

<p>'Ten tickets! what do you mean?' asked Rougon, quite
confused.</p>

<p>When he had recovered his self-possession, she burst into
a laugh. It delighted her to bewitch him and intoxicate him
in this way, and when he opened his arms to clasp her, to
elude him with a laugh. She seemed in high glee. At this
Rougon turned very pale, and cast a furious glance at her,
which only served to increase her merriment. 'Well, I think
I'd better be off now,' she said. 'You're not polite enough
for ladies' society. No, really, my mother will be expecting
me.'</p>

<p>Rougon, however, had resumed his paternal manner, and
told her that she must spare him another five minutes. He
had got tired of the work he was doing when she came in,
he said; it was a report to be presented to the Senate on
certain petitions. Then he began to talk to her about the
Empress, for whom she professed enthusiastic devotion.
The Empress, said he, had been at Biarritz for the last
week. At this the girl again leant back in her arm-chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and began to chatter. She knew Biarritz very well; she
had once spent a season there, before it had become such a
fashionable watering-place; and she very much regretted that
she was unable to revisit it while the Court was there.
Then she went on to describe a meeting of the Academy to
which M. de Plouguern had taken her on the previous day.
An author had been admitted as a member, and she made
many jokes at the expense of his baldness. She had a horror
of books, she declared. Whenever she tried to read, she had
to go off to bed, suffering from terrible nervous attacks. She
could not understand what she read. Then, on Rougon
telling her that the author received at the Academy on the
previous day was an enemy of the Emperor's, and that his
discourse had swarmed with abominable allusions, she seemed
quite astounded.</p>

<p>'Why, he looked such a nice man!' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>But Rougon also had begun to inveigh against books.
A novel had just been published, he said, which had aroused
his utmost indignation. It was a work of the most depraved
kind, which, while claiming to portray the exact truth,
dragged the reader through all the wild fancies of an
hysterical woman.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The word hysterical seemed to please
him, for he repeated it three times; but when Clorinde
asked him to explain what he meant by it, he refused to
answer, suddenly becoming very prudish.</p>

<p>'Everything may be said,' he continued, 'only there is a
fitting way of saying it. In administrative matters, for
instance, we are frequently obliged to tackle very delicate
subjects. I have read, for example, reports upon certain
matters which have been very precise, very detailed; but
they have been written in a clear, simple, straightforward
style, so that there was nothing unchaste or impure about
the document. But our present-day novelists have adopted
a style which is full of suggestiveness, a manner of describing
things which makes it appear as if they were
actually going on before you. They call that art. To me
it seems to be simply indecency and bad taste.'</p>

<p>Then he went on to speak of authors, whom he had
never read, but whom, like many other people, he accused of
the grossest immorality. And yet while he was thus prating
of virtue and denouncing vice, he was cleverly manœuvring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
to get behind Clorinde's chair without her being aware of it.
The girl was gazing at the ceiling with an expression of
absent-mindedness. 'Oh, as for novels,' she murmured, 'I
have never even opened one. They are all a pack of falsehoods.
You don't know <i>Leonora, the Gipsy</i>, do you? It is
a pretty book. I read it in Italian when I was quite little.
It is about a young girl who ends by marrying a lord. She
is captured by brigands to begin with——'</p>

<p>However, a slight grating sound behind her made her
start and turn her head: 'What are you doing?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I am pulling the blind down,' replied Rougon; 'I was
afraid the sun was inconveniencing you.'</p>

<p>The girl was, indeed, sitting in a flood of sunlight, whose
dancing dust gilded her corsage as with luminous down.
'Please leave the blind alone,' she cried, 'I love the sun. I
feel as though I were in a warm bath.'</p>

<p>Then she raised herself in her chair and glanced into
the garden. But when she saw the gardener still kneeling
there, with the back of his blue blouse turned towards them,
she reverted to her reclining attitude again, smiling, and
easy once more. Rougon, who had followed her glance, left
the blind as it was, and the girl began to banter him. He
was just like an owl, she said, to be so fond of darkness.
However, he showed no resentment, but began to pace the
room, swaying about like a bear contemplating some wily act
of treachery.</p>

<p>'Oh, come and look here,' he said at last, pointing to a
large photograph; 'you haven't seen my last portrait, have
you?'</p>

<p>But she merely smiled, and replied: 'Oh! I can see it
very well from here; and, besides, you've shown it to me
before.'</p>

<p>Rougon was not yet discouraged. He drew down the
blind of the other window, and invented several reasons to
induce the girl to go into the shady corner which he had
made by doing so. She would be much more comfortable
there, he told her. But Clorinde, despising this obvious
snare, merely shook her head. Then Rougon came and
stood in front of her; and, dropping all attempts at
stratagem, said straightforwardly: 'Oh, by the way, I want
to show you my new horse, Monarque. You know that I
have been making an exchange. You are fond of horses,
and you shall tell me what you think of him.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>But the girl still refused to move. Then Rougon began
to press her. The stable was only a few yards away. It
wouldn't take her more than five minutes at the most. She
continued to refuse, however, and thereupon Rougon murmured
with a touch of scorn in his voice: 'What! are you
afraid?'</p>

<p>At this she started up, as though lashed with a whip.
She looked very grave and somewhat pale.</p>

<p>'Let us go and look at Monarque,' she said quietly.</p>

<p>As she gathered up the train of her riding-habit she fixed
her eyes upon Rougon's, and for a moment they remained
gazing at each other as if to read each other's thoughts. It
was a challenge given and accepted, without any pretence of
concealment. Then she led the way down the steps while
Rougon, by force of habit, buttoned the house-coat which he
was wearing. But the girl had only taken a step or two along
the garden-walk when she stopped short. 'Wait a moment,'
she said.</p>

<p>She went back into the room, and when she returned, she
was toying with her riding-whip, which she had left behind
the cushion of the couch. Rougon glanced at the whip, and
then slowly raised his eyes to Clorinde. She was smiling
again, and once more she walked on in front of him.</p>

<p>The stable was at the end of the garden, on the right.
When they passed the gardener, the man was gathering up
his tools and preparing to go away. Rougon, bareheaded in
the blazing sun, followed Clorinde, who went quietly onward,
tapping the shrubs with her riding-whip as she passed them.
Neither spoke a word. Clorinde did not even turn her head.
On reaching the stable, she waited while Rougon opened the
door, and then went inside, in front of him. The door, which
Rougon swung back, closed noisily, and Clorinde still smiled,
her face wearing an open expression, in which pride and confidence
were clearly to be read.</p>

<p>The stable was a small and commonplace one, with four
oak stalls. Although the slabs had been washed that morning,
and the racks and mangers and other wood-work were
kept scrupulously clean, there was a strong scent about the
place, and the atmosphere was warm and damp, like that of a
Turkish bath. From each of the two round dormer-windows
there fell but a pale glimmer of light, and the corners remained
wrapt in gloom. Clorinde, having just left the bright sunshine
of the garden, could at first distinguish nothing; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
she kept still, and did not open the door again for fear lest
Rougon should think she was alarmed. Only two of the
stalls were occupied. The horses snorted and turned their
heads.</p>

<p>'This is the one, isn't it?' asked Clorinde, when her eyes
had grown accustomed to the gloom. 'He looks a very nice
animal.'</p>

<p>She patted the horse gently, and then slipped inside the
stall, stroking the animal as she went without showing the
least sign of fear. She wanted to see his head, she said;
and when she had made her way to the far end of the stall,
Rougon could hear her kissing the horse's nose. The sound
of those kisses exasperated him.</p>

<p>'Come back, I beg you!' he cried. 'If he were to step on
one side, you might be crushed to death!'</p>

<p>But the girl only laughed, kissed the horse more affectionately
than before, and spoke to him caressingly, while he, at
this unexpected fondling, fairly quivered with pleasure. At
last she came out of the stall again. She was very fond of
horses, she said, they always knew her, and never tried
to hurt her, even when she teased them. She knew how to
manage them. Some were very skittish, but this one seemed
very steady. Then she stooped down behind the horse, and
lifted one of its hoofs with both hands as if to examine it.
The animal remained quite still.</p>

<p>Rougon gazed at her while she thus stooped before him;
but all at once she felt a slight touch under her arm-pits.
She did not even start, however; she went on examining the
horse's hoof, till the touch became more pronounced, and
then letting the hoof drop, she stood up and inquired: 'What
is the matter with you? What has come over you?'</p>

<p>Then, as Rougon suddenly tried to clasp her round the
waist, she rapped his knuckles smartly, and, stationing herself
against the wall in front of the stalls, raised the train of her
riding-habit, which was thrown over her left arm, as a shield,
while in her right hand she held her whip uplifted. Rougon's
lips were trembling, but he did not say a word; Clorinde,
however, seeming quite at ease, went on talking freely: 'You
can't touch me, you'll see,' she said. 'When I was younger,
I used to take fencing-lessons. I'm sorry I did not go on
with them. Come, look out for your fingers! There! what
did I tell you?'</p>

<p>She seemed to be only in fun. She did not strike Rougon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
severely, but just playfully lashed at him whenever his hands
came too near. She was so quick in her defence that
he could not even touch her dress. A perfect hail came
clattering down upon him on every side. Before long he was
tingling all over, and stepped back panting, with his face very
red, and drops of perspiration trickling down his brow. Then,
however, his manner changed, and still without a word he
advanced menacingly; but Clorinde, though smiling and talking
as before, at once struck him several smart blows of increasing
severity. She looked very beautiful as she stood there
with her skirts drawn tightly, and her corsage yielding to
every movement of her lissom figure. She was like a sinuous,
bluish-black serpent, and whenever she raised her arm to
strike, at the same time slightly throwing her head back, her
throat and bosom formed a charming curve.</p>

<p>'Well, now,' she exclaimed, with a laugh, 'have you had
enough? You'll be the first to tire, I think, my friend.'</p>

<p>But in her turn she suddenly stopped talking. Rougon's
eyes were glaring fiercely now, and his face was quite crimson.
Then a bright light also appeared in Clorinde's eyes, and she
seemed to revel in the whipping she was administering to
him. Again and again did she wheel and slash about her.
And at last, as he, goaded to fury, made a yet more desperate
onslaught, she put forth all her strength and cut him clean
across the face from ear to ear.</p>

<p>'Hussy!' he cried, and broke into a torrent of coarse
language, abominable charges, swearing and sputtering, half-choked
by his excitement.</p>

<p>She did not deign to reply. For a moment she stood
there motionless and haughtily calm like a statue, with her
face very pale.</p>

<p>But he burst into a strain of passionate pleading; and
thereupon she looked at him and answered: 'Well, then,
marry me!'</p>

<p>At this, however, Rougon, as if recovering his self-possession,
forced a laugh, a sneering, insulting laugh, and shook
his head.</p>

<p>Her retort, the only one that womanly pride could dictate,
came swift and forcible. Then neither spoke again.</p>

<p>The horses in the stalls had turned their heads and were
snorting, disturbed by the contest which they had heard.
The sun had just risen high enough to shine through the
dormer-windows, and two golden beams sent sparkles dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
through the gloom of the stable. Clorinde, now perfectly
calm again, slipped up to Monarque's head, with her whip
under her arm. She gave the horse two kisses on the
muzzle and exclaimed: 'Good-bye, old fellow. You, at any
rate, know how to behave yourself.'</p>

<p>Rougon, quite crushed and ashamed, was also now perfectly
calm. With his hands still quivering he straightened
his cravat, and felt his coat to ascertain if it was properly
buttoned. Then they walked quietly back through the garden.
Rougon's left cheek was stinging him, and he dabbed it with
his handkerchief. When they reached his study, Clorinde's
first glance was for the timepiece. 'That makes thirty-two
tickets,' she said with a smile.</p>

<p>As Rougon looked at her in surprise, she once more broke
into a laugh, and continued: 'You had better send me off at
once. The hand is moving forward. The thirty-third minute
has begun. See, I'm putting the tickets on your desk.'</p>

<p>Rougon gave her three hundred and twenty francs without
a moment's hesitation. Scarcely did his fingers tremble as he
counted out the gold. It was a fine which he had inflicted
upon himself. Then Clorinde, carried away by the manner
in which he put down such a sum of money, stepped up to
him with an adorable expression, offering him her cheek.
And when he had kissed it in a fatherly fashion, she went off,
looking quite delighted, and saying: 'Thank you for the poor
girls. I have only seven tickets left now. My godfather will
take those.'</p>

<p>As soon as Rougon was alone again, he sat down at his
desk by sheer force of habit. He resumed his work, and for
some minutes wrote and consulted the papers that were lying
in front of him. Then he held up his pen, and a grave expression
came over his face as he gazed blankly through the
open window into the garden. He again saw Clorinde's lithe
form swaying before him like some bluish serpent. She glided
on and entered the room, and sprang up on the living tail
which her habit seemed to form. He saw her quivering as
her arms uncoiled towards him; and gradually the room
seemed full of her presence. Silently, passionately, it pervaded
everything: the carpet, the chairs, the curtains, diffusing
over all a penetrating perfume.</p>

<p>Then Rougon violently threw his pen down and rose in
anger. Was that girl now going to prevent him from working?
Was he going mad that he should see things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
had no existence? he whose brain was so strong! He recalled
to his mind a woman, nigh whom he had many a time
written the whole night long, when he was a student, without
even noticing her gentle breathing. Then he drew up the
blind, and to establish a draught opened the other window
and a door on the opposite side of the room, as though he
were stifling. And with angry gestures similar to those with
which he would have driven away some dangerous wasp, he
tried to drive away the scent of Clorinde by flapping his
handkerchief in the air. When he no longer noticed it, he
drew a deep breath and again dabbed his face with his handkerchief
to assuage the burning heat which Clorinde had
brought there.</p>

<p>He could not, however, go on with the work he had commenced,
but still slowly paced the room, from one end to the
other. As he caught sight of himself in a mirror, he noticed
a red mark on his left cheek. Clorinde's whip had only left a
slight scratch behind it, and he could easily ascribe that to
some trifling accident. However, although his skin revealed
but a slight red line, his flesh still smarted with the slashing,
galling cut. So he hastened to a little lavatory, curtained off
from the rest of the room, and plunged his head into a basin
of water. That afforded him considerable relief. He dreaded
lest the whipping he had received from Clorinde should only
sharpen his passion. He felt afraid to think about her till
the scratch on his cheek should be quite healed; the smarting
which he felt seemed to descend and thrill his whole body.</p>

<p>'No! never! I won't!' he said aloud, as he came back
into his room. 'It would be madness!'</p>

<p>He threw himself on the couch and clenched his fists.
Then a servant came in and told him that his <i>déjeuner</i> was
getting cold, but he still sat there, struggling with himself.
His stern, set face distended with the contest that was raging
within him; his bull-like neck grew swollen and his muscles
strained, as though silently, within his vitals, he were striving
to suffocate some animal bent on devouring him. The battle
went on for ten long minutes. He could not remember
having ever exerted himself like this before; and, when he
got up, he was quite pallid and his neck was moist with
perspiration.</p>

<p>On the next two days Rougon admitted no one to see him.
He shut himself up with a pile of work. He sat up one whole
night. Three times again, when his servant came into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
room, he found him lying on the couch, exhausted and with
an alarming look on his face. On the evening of the second
day, however, he dressed to go to Delestang's, where he was
engaged to dine. But, instead of at once crossing the Champs
Élysées, he turned up the avenue and entered the Balbis'
house. It was only six o'clock.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle isn't at home,' said the little servant Antonia,
laughing like a black goat, as she stopped him on the
staircase.</p>

<p>Rougon raised his voice on the chance of making himself
heard, and was hesitating whether he should go down again,
when Clorinde appeared up above, leaning over the balusters.
'Come up!' she called. 'What an idiot that girl is! She
never understands anything that is told her.'</p>

<p>When Rougon reached the first floor, Clorinde took him
into a small room adjoining her bedchamber. It was a
dressing-room, with light blue wall-paper of a flowery pattern,
but she had furnished it with a big dingy mahogany desk, an
arm-chair upholstered in leather, and a nest of pasteboard
boxes. Papers were lying about, thickly covered with dust.
The place looked like the office of some disreputable process
server. To accommodate Rougon the girl was obliged to fetch
a chair from her bedroom. 'I was expecting you,' she called
out as she went there.</p>

<p>When she came back with the chair, she explained to him
that she was busy with her correspondence. She showed him
on her desk some big sheets of yellowish paper, covered with
large round handwriting. Then, as he sat down, she noticed
that he was in evening dress.</p>

<p>'Have you come to ask for my hand?' she said in a
playful way.</p>

<p>'Exactly,' he replied. Then he added with a smile: 'Not
for myself, but for one of my friends.'</p>

<p>Clorinde gazed at him doubtfully, unable to tell whether
he was joking or not. She was dirty and untidy, and was
wearing an ill-fitting dressing-gown; but, nevertheless she
looked very beautiful, like some antique statue which is soiled
by the dust of a broker's shop, but whose beauty is beyond the
power of dirt to conceal. And while she sucked one of her
fingers which she had just smeared with ink, her eyes fell
upon the slight scar which was still visible on Rougon's left
cheek. Presently she said, in a low voice and with an air
of absent-mindedness: 'I was sure you would come, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
expected you sooner.' Then, seeming to wake up, she continued
in a louder tone: 'So it is for one of your friends;
your dearest friend, no doubt.'</p>

<p>She laughed sonorously. She now felt sure that Rougon
had meant himself. She had a strong desire to touch his scar
in order to satisfy herself that she had really put her mark
upon him and that henceforth he belonged to her. But he
took hold of her wrists and made her sit down in the leather-covered
arm-chair.</p>

<p>'Let us have a little talk,' he said. 'We are good friends,
aren't we? I have been thinking a good deal since the day
before yesterday. You have been in my mind the whole time.
I fancied that we had got married, and that we had been living
together for three months. You'll never guess in what occupation
I saw us engaged.'</p>

<p>Clorinde said nothing; she felt a little embarrassed, in
spite of all her self-assurance.</p>

<p>'Well, I saw us standing by the fire-place,' he continued.
'You had taken up the shovel and I had seized the tongs, and
we were belabouring each other.'</p>

<p>This idea struck Clorinde as so comical that she threw herself
back in her chair and burst into ringing laughter.</p>

<p>'No, don't laugh,' said Rougon; 'I'm quite serious. It
isn't worth while uniting our lives just to beat each other. I
swear to you that is what would happen. First there would
be blows, and then a separation. Be quite sure of this, that
it is useless trying to assimilate two strong wills like ours.'</p>

<p>'And so?' she asked, becoming very grave.</p>

<p>'And so I think that the most sensible thing we can do is
to shake hands and make up our minds to be nothing but
good friends in the future.'</p>

<p>Clorinde made no reply, but fixed her eyes searchingly and
blackly upon Rougon's. A terrible frown like that of an
offended goddess appeared on her Olympian brow. And her
lips quivered slightly with a silent expression of scorn.</p>

<p>'Will you excuse me?' she said. Then, drawing her
chair to her desk, she began to fold her letters. She used
large yellow envelopes, such as are employed in French
government offices, and fastened them with sealing-wax. She
had lighted a taper and was watching the wax blaze. Rougon
quietly waited till she had finished.</p>

<p>'And you came here to tell me that?' she resumed at last,
without desisting from her work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Rougon in his turn made no immediate reply. He wanted
to get a glimpse of the girl's face. When she at last turned
her chair round again, he smiled at her and tried to catch her
eye. Then he kissed her hand, as though anxious to soften
her; but she still remained cold and haughty.</p>

<p>'I told you,' he said, 'that I have come to ask you in
marriage on behalf of one of my friends.'</p>

<p>Then he spoke at length. He loved her, he told her, much
more than she imagined. He loved her particularly because she
was intelligent and able. It cost him a great deal to give her up,
but he was sacrificing his passion for their mutual advantage.
He would like to see her ruling her own house. He pictured
her married to a wealthy man whom she would mould to her
own will. She would rule instead of having to surrender
herself. That would be much better—would it not?—than
for them to paralyse one another. He and she could speak
out openly to each other. He ended by calling her his child.
She was his perverse daughter, he said; her diplomatic bent
of mind delighted him, and it would distress him very much
to see her career end unsatisfactorily.</p>

<p>'Is that all?' she said, when he finished. She had
listened to him with the greatest attention. And, raising her
eyes to his face, she continued: 'If you want to get me married
in the expectation of anything, I warn you that you are mistaken.
Never! I told you.'</p>

<p>'What an idea!' he exclaimed, slightly blushing. Then
he coughed, and took a paper-knife off the desk and began to
examine its handle in order to conceal the trouble he was
feeling. But the girl was deep in thought again, paying no
attention to him.</p>

<p>'And who is the husband?' she eventually asked.</p>

<p>'Can't you guess?'</p>

<p>Then a faint smile came to her face once more, and she
shrugged her shoulders, and began to drum on the desk with
her finger tips. She knew very well who it was. 'He is so
stupid,' she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>But Rougon began to defend Delestang. He was a very
well-bred man, and she would be able to do what she liked
with him. And he gave her particulars as to his health and
fortune and habits. Moreover, he promised that he would
use all his influence in their favour should he ever return to
power. Delestang was, perhaps, scarcely a man of lofty intelligence,
but he would not be out of place in any position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh, yes, he'd scrape on well enough; I'm willing to allow
that,' she said, with a frank laugh. And she continued, after
a pause: 'Well, I don't say no; perhaps you are right.
Monsieur Delestang is not distasteful to me.'</p>

<p>She looked at Rougon as she spoke those last words. She
fancied she had noticed upon several occasions that he
was jealous of Delestang. But so far as she could see not a
muscle of his face now moved. He had found strength
enough to destroy his passion in two days. And he seemed
quite delighted with the success of his scheme, and again
began to expatiate upon the advantages of such a marriage, as
though he were some shrewd attorney negotiating an affair
from which she would derive especial profit. He took her
hands in his own and patted them affectionately, as he went
on: 'It was last night that the idea struck me, and I said to
myself, "It's the very thing!" I shouldn't like you to
remain unmarried. You are the only woman who seems
to me to be really deserving of a husband. Delestang settles
everything. With him one has elbow-room.' Then he added
gaily: 'I feel convinced that you will reward me by letting
me see some very wonderful things.'</p>

<p>'Is Monsieur Delestang aware of your plans?' Clorinde
now inquired.</p>

<p>Rougon looked at her in surprise for a moment, as though
she had said something which he had not expected from her.
Then he calmly replied: 'No; it was no use saying anything
to him. I will tell him all about it later on.'</p>

<p>The girl had just resumed the sealing of her letters.
After pressing a large blank seal upon the wax she turned the
envelopes over and slowly addressed them in big handwriting.
And as she tossed the letters to her right, Rougon tried to
read the addresses. The names were mostly those of well-known
Italian politicians. She must have noticed what he
was doing, however, for, as she rose and collected her letters
to send them to the post, she remarked: 'When my mother
has one of her headaches, I have to do the letter-writing.'</p>

<p>When Rougon was left to himself, he began to walk about
the little room. The pasteboard boxes in the stand were all
labelled <i>'Receipts,' 'Letters,'</i> and so on, like those of some
man of business. He smiled, however, when among the
litter of papers on the desk, he caught sight of a pair of old
split stays. There was a piece of soap, too, in the inkstand,
and some scraps of blue satin on the floor, clippings which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
fallen during the mending of a skirt, and had not been swept
away. The door leading to Clorinde's bedroom was ajar, and
Rougon had the curiosity to peep inside; but the shutters
were closed and the room was so dark that he could only see
the shadowy folds of the bed-curtains. Just then, too,
Clorinde came back.</p>

<p>'I must be off,' Rougon said to her. 'I am going to dine
with your man this evening. Do you give me full permission
to act?'</p>

<p>The girl made no reply. She had turned quite gloomy
again, as though she had been reconsidering the matter on
the staircase. Rougon had already got his hand upon the
balusters, but she brought him back into the room and closed
the door. Her dream was being dispelled, the hope of which
she had felt so sure that only an hour previously she had
regarded it as a certainty. The burning flush that comes
from a deadly insult rose to her cheeks. She felt as though
she had received a blow.</p>

<p>'Then you mean it seriously?' she said, turning her
back to the light, so that Rougon might not see how flushed
her face was.</p>

<p>When he had repeated his arguments for the third time,
she remained silent. She was afraid that if she began to
speak on the subject she would be carried away by an impulse
of wild anger, which she could feel surging within her, and
she feared she might strike Rougon in revenge for this
crumbling away of the future which she had planned for herself.
But it was only a momentary impulse. She was soon
calm again, and then slowly asked, 'You wish this marriage
to take place?'</p>

<p>Rougon did not hesitate, but answered in a full clear tone
'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Very well; let it be then.'</p>

<p>With slow steps, they returned to the door and went out
on to the landing, both looking extremely calm. The only signs
of Rougon's last victory over himself were a few drops of
perspiration on his brow. Clorinde held herself erect, certain
of her power. They stood looking at each other in silence
for a moment, having nothing further to say, and yet unable
to part. At last, as Rougon took the girl's hand to say good-bye,
she detained him for an instant, and said without trace
of anger: 'You think yourself much cleverer than I am, but
you are mistaken. You will perhaps be sorry some day.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Her threats went no further. She leant over the balusters
and watched him go down the stairs. When he got to the
bottom, he raised his head and they smiled at one another.
She had no thought of taking any puerile vengeance upon
him; she was already dreaming of punishing him by some
splendid future triumph of her own. And as she went back
to the dressing-room, she caught herself murmuring, 'Ah,
well! all roads lead to Rome.'</p>

<p>That very evening Rougon began to lay siege to Delestang's
heart. He told him of some very flattering imaginary
remarks which Mademoiselle Balbi had made of him at the
banquet at the Hôtel de Ville; and afterwards he never
wearied of discoursing to him about the young girl's extraordinary
beauty. He, who had formerly warned him so
strongly to be on his guard against women, now did his best
to deliver him over to Clorinde bound hand and foot. One
day he would dwell upon the rare beauty of her hands; on
another, he would glorify her figure, describing it in the most
alluring language. Delestang, whose inflammable heart was
already full of Clorinde's image, was soon stirred by hot passion.
When Rougon told him that he himself had never
thought about her, he confessed that he had been in love with
her for the last six months, but had kept silent on the subject
from fear of being too late. He now began to go to the Rue
Marbeuf every evening to talk about her. There seemed to be
a general conspiracy against him. He never spoke to anyone
without hearing enthusiastic praises of the girl he loved.
Even the Charbonnels stopped him one morning on the
Place de la Concorde to express their admiration of the
'beautiful young lady whom they saw about with him everywhere.'</p>

<p>Clorinde, on her side, wore a smiling face. She had
planned out her life afresh, and in a few days had grown
accustomed to the new part she was to play. She did not
attempt to win Delestang by the same bold tactics with
which she had tried to subjugate Rougon. She quite
changed her manner, affected soft languor, guileless innocence,
and such a nervous disposition, that too tender a
squeeze of the hand would upset her. When Delestang told
Rougon that she had fainted in his arms just because he had
kissed her wrist, the latter pretended to consider this as a
convincing proof of her purity of mind. So at last Delestang
began to think seriously about marrying her, and went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
consult Rougon on the subject. But when the latter found
his plans so near realisation he, just for a moment, felt so
hurt and angry that he almost told Delestang then and
there of all that had passed between himself and Clorinde.
However, he refrained, and proceeded very cleverly to work
upon the other's feelings. He did not actually advise him to
marry Clorinde, but led him on to this determination by
remarks that seemed almost irrelevant to the subject. He
had been much surprised, he said, to hear the unpleasant
stories which had been circulated about Mademoiselle Balbi,
but he did not believe them, for he had made searching
inquiries without discovering anything to her disadvantage.
Moreover, a man ought not to doubt the woman he loved.
Those were his last words.</p>

<p>Six weeks later, as Rougon came out of the Madeleine,
where the marriage had just been celebrated with great
magnificence, he said to a deputy who was expressing his
astonishment at Delestang's choice: 'Well, what could you
expect of him? I warned him a hundred times. But he
was sure to be taken in by a woman some day.'</p>

<p>Towards the end of the winter, when Delestang and his
wife returned from travelling in Italy, they learnt that
Rougon was on the point of marrying Mademoiselle Beulin-d'Orchère.
When they went to see him, Clorinde congratulated
him very gracefully. He pretended that he was really
taking the step to please his friends. For the last three
months, he said, they had let him have no peace, but had
constantly repeated that a man in his position ought to be
married. He added with a laugh that when his friends came
to see him in the evenings, there wasn't even a woman in the
house to pour out the tea.</p>

<p>'Oh! so it's a sudden decision of yours; you never
thought of it before, I suppose,' remarked Clorinde with a
smile. 'You ought to have got married at the same time
as we did, so that we could all have gone to Italy together.'</p>

<p>Then she began to question him playfully. No doubt
it was his friend, Du Poizat, who had suggested this pretty
idea. But this was denied by Rougon, who asserted that
Du Poizat was strongly opposed to the marriage, as he personally
abominated M. Beulin-d'Orchère. All the rest, however,
M. Kahn, M. Béjuin, Madame Correur, and even the
Charbonnels, had never wearied of singing the praises of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Mademoiselle Véronique. According to them, she would
bring every imaginable virtue, prosperity and charm into
his home. Then he concluded jocosely: 'She seems to have
been made on purpose for me, and so I really couldn't refuse
to take her.' And he added with a subtle smile: 'Besides, if
we are going to have war in the autumn, it is necessary to
think about making alliances.'</p>

<p>Clorinde expressed her perfect approval; and she, too,
began to sing Mademoiselle Beulin-d'Orchère's praises,
though she had only seen her once. Delestang, who had
hitherto confined himself to nodding, without ever taking
his eyes off his wife, now commenced an enthusiastic disquisition
upon the advantages of marriage. And he was
starting on a detailed account of his own happiness, when
his wife rose and said they had another visit to make. As
Rougon escorted them to the door, she held him back for a
moment, letting her husband go on in front.</p>

<p>'Didn't I tell you that you would be married within the
twelvemonth?' she whispered softly in his ear.</p>



<hr class="chap">
<h3><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a></h3>

<h3>IN RETIREMENT</h3>


<p>Summer came round. Rougon was leading a life of perfect
quietude. In three months' time Madame Rougon had replaced
the somewhat equivocal tone of the house in the Rue
Marbeuf by one of solemn respectability. An atmosphere of
propriety pervaded the rather chilly rooms, where all was
spick and span. The furniture, always in place, the closely
drawn curtains, allowing but little light to enter, and the
thick carpets muffling every sound, imparted an air of almost
conventual austerity to the house. Moreover, everything
seemed to have acquired an appearance of age; it was as if
one had entered some ancient musty patriarchal abode. That
tall plain woman exercised an ever-watchful surveillance over
everything, gliding through the subdued stillness of the house
with noiseless steps; and she managed matters in such a
discreet ready way that it seemed as if she had spent twenty
years in the place instead of a few months.</p>

<p>Rougon smiled when people congratulated him. He still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
asserted that he had got married on the advice of his friends,
and that his bride was their choice. She made him very
happy. He had long desired to have a quiet decorous home,
which might stand forth as a material proof of his respectability.
It freed him from all his doubtful past and placed
him amongst honest men. There was still a deal of provincialism
in his nature, and certain substantially furnished
drawing-rooms that he remembered at Plassans, where the
chairs and couches were kept swathed in white coverings the
whole year round, still formed his ideals. When he called at
Delestang's, where Clorinde made an extravagant display of
luxury, he showed his contempt by shrugging his shoulders.
Nothing seemed to him so ridiculous as throwing money, as
it were, out of the window; not that he was miserly, but he
said that he could find enjoyments far preferable to those that
were to be purchased with money. He had committed to his
wife the care of their fortune. Previously he had lived
without calculating his expenses, but now Madame Rougon
attended to money matters with the same zealous care as she
showed in managing the house.</p>

<p>For the first few months after his marriage, Rougon lived
a life of seclusion, preparing for the contest which he dreamt
of. He loved power for its own sake, without any hankering
for riches and honours. Very ignorant, and of little skill in
things which were not connected with the management of
men, it was only his keen craving for power that elevated him
to a position of superiority. The ambition of raising himself
above the crowd, which seemed to him to be compounded of
fools and knaves, and of leading and driving men by sheer
force, developed most energetic skill and cunning in his heavy
nature. He believed only in himself, took his convictions
for reasons, and held everything subordinate to the increase
of his personal influence. Addicted to no vice, he yet revelled
as at some secret orgy in the idea of wielding supreme power.
Though he had inherited his father's massive shoulders and
heavy face, he had derived from his mother, the redoubtable
Félicité who governed Plassans, a strong fiery will and passion
for force which made him disdainful of petty means and
commonplace gratifications. He was certainly the greatest of
the Rougons.</p>

<p>When he found himself solitary and unoccupied after
years of active life, his first feeling was one of delightful
drowsiness. It was as though he had had no sleep since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
exciting days of 1851, and he accepted his dismissal as a well-deserved
holiday earned by long service. He proposed to hold
himself aloof for six months, which would give him time to
choose a better battle-ground, and then at his own discretion
he could join in the great fight again. But in a few weeks' time
he was already weary of resting. He had never before been so
clearly conscious of his own strength; and his head and limbs
became a source of embarrassment to him now that he was
no longer actively employing them. He spent whole days in
pacing his little garden and yawning wearily, like one of those
caged lions whom one sees restlessly stretching their stiffened
limbs. And now he began to know a most distasteful existence,
the overwhelming weariness of which he carefully strove
to conceal. To his friends he professed himself perfectly
happy, and declared that he was well pleased to be 'out of
the muddle,' but his heavy eyelids would rise occasionally in
order that he might watch the course of events, and then
again drop over his glistening eyes as soon as he saw anyone
looking at him. What helped more than anything else to
keep him erect was the unpopularity which he realised he
had incurred. His fall seemed to have caused much satisfaction.
Not a day passed without some newspaper attacking him;
he was spoken of as the personification of the <i>coup d'état</i>,
the proscriptions, and of all the other violent measures to
which people referred in veiled language; and some writers
even went so far as to congratulate the Emperor upon having
severed his connection with a servant who had done his best
to compromise him.</p>

<p>At the Tuileries the feeling of hostility against Rougon
was even more marked. Marsy, now triumphant, assailed
him with witticisms which ladies retailed through the drawing-rooms
of Paris. This bitterness, however, actually comforted
Rougon and confirmed him in his contempt for the human
flock of sheep. They had not forgotten him; they detested
him; and that seemed very sweet. Himself against the
world! It was a thought which had a peculiar charm for
him; and he saw himself standing alone, whip in hand, and
forcing the yelping pack to keep their distance. He revelled
in the insults which were offered to him, and held his head
higher than ever in his haughty seclusion.</p>

<p>His brawny body, however, was suffering terribly from his
enforced inactivity. If he had dared, he would have seized a
spade and dug up his garden. However, he preferred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
commence a long piece of writing in which he would carefully
compare the English constitution with the Imperial constitution
of 1852, with the idea of proving—all allowance made
for the history and political customs of the two nations—that
the French had as much liberty as the English. However,
when he had consulted all the necessary authorities and
collected sufficient notes, he had to force himself into taking
up the pen. He could easily have made a long speech on the
subject before the Chamber, but to write a treatise in which
each sentence must be carefully thought out appeared to him
a task of immense difficulty; and one, too, of no immediate
usefulness. To express himself in good literary style had
always embarrassed him, and it was for this reason that he
pretended to hold style in contempt. He only got ten pages
of his treatise written, still he left the manuscript on his
desk, though he did not add twenty lines to it a week. On
the other hand, whenever anybody asked him how he employed
his time, he explained his project at great length, and
dwelt on its great import. This was the excuse which he
employed to conceal the hateful emptiness of his life.</p>

<p>Months went on, and he turned a yet more serene and
smiling face to the world. Not a sign of the utter weariness
he was suffering did he allow to appear. When his intimates
sympathised with him, he assured them of his perfect felicity
and gave them the most convincing reasons for it. Had he
not everything to make him happy? he asked. He delighted
in study, and now he could work as he listed, which was
infinitely preferable to the feverish agitation of public life.
As the Emperor had no need of his services, he did well to
leave him in quietude in his little corner. He never spoke of
the Emperor in other terms than those of profound devotion.
Still, he frequently said that at a sign from his master he was
perfectly willing to take up the burden of power again, adding,
however, that he would not venture on a single step to provoke
that sign. To all appearances, indeed, he was very
anxious to keep aloof. Amidst the quietude of those early
years of the Empire, amidst the nation's strange stupor born
of mingled dread and weariness, he could hear faint sounds as
of a coming awakening, and, as a supreme hope, he reckoned
on some catastrophe which would suddenly make him necessary
to the State. He was the man for critical situations,
'the man with the big paws,' as M. de Marsy had put it.</p>

<p>The Rougons received their friends at their house in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Rue Marbeuf on Sundays and Thursdays. They chatted in
the big red drawing-room till half-past ten o'clock, at which
time Rougon pitilessly turned them out of doors, for he held
that late hours fogged the brain. Exactly at ten o'clock,
Madame Rougon herself served tea. Two plates of little
cakes accompanied the tea, but no one ever touched them.</p>

<p>On the Thursday in the July of that year which followed
the general elections, the whole band was assembled in the
drawing-room at eight o'clock. Madame Bouchard, Madame
Charbonnel, and Madame Correur sat in a circle near an open
window to inhale the occasional whiffs of fresh air which
came in from the little garden, and in their midst M. d'Escorailles
related the pranks he had played in his Plassans
days, when he had often gone off to Monaco for twelve hours
or so, on the pretext of taking part in a shooting expedition
with a friend. Madame Rougon, who, dressed in black, sat
half concealed behind a curtain, paid no attention to all this,
but would now and again quietly rise and leave the room.
She frequently disappeared for a quarter of an hour at a
time. M. Charbonnel, however, was perched at the edge of
an easy chair near the ladies, in amazement at hearing a
young man of high rank confessing such adventures. At the
other end of the room stood Clorinde, listening inattentively
to a conversation on crops which her husband and M. Béjuin
had started. She wore a creamy dress, freely trimmed with
straw-coloured ribbons, and she gently tapped the palm of her
left hand with her fan while gazing at the bright globe of the
one lamp with which the drawing-room was lighted. Meantime,
Colonel Jobelin and M. Bouchard were playing piquet
at a card-table, while Rougon, like a fortune-teller, was consulting
a pack of cards in a corner, setting them out on the
green cloth in a grave and methodical manner. This was his
favourite amusement on Thursdays and Sundays, affording
occupation both for his fingers and his mind.</p>

<p>'Well, will it come off?' Clorinde asked with a smile as
she approached him.</p>

<p>'It always comes off,' he replied quietly.</p>

<p>She remained standing on the other side of the table
while he dealt the pack into eight small heaps.</p>

<p>When he had turned the cards over and picked them up
in pairs—two aces, two kings, two queens, and so forth—she
remarked, 'Yes, you have managed it all right. But what
did you want the cards to tell you?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Rougon slowly raised his eyes as though surprised at the
question. 'What kind of weather we shall have to-morrow,'
he said at length.</p>

<p>Then he began to deal the cards afresh. Delestang and
M. Béjuin had now ceased talking, and the silence was only
broken by pretty Madame Bouchard's rippling laugh. Clorinde
stepped up to a window and stood there for a moment peering
into the deepening twilight.</p>

<p>'Is there any news of poor Monsieur Kahn?' she asked,
without turning her head.</p>

<p>'I've had a letter from him,' said Rougon. 'I am
expecting him this evening.'</p>

<p>Then the conversation turned upon M. Kahn's ill-fortune.
During the last session of the Corps Législatif, he had been
imprudent enough to criticise a government bill rather sharply,
as, by authorising a very dangerous competition in a neighbouring
district, it threatened the Bressuire blast-furnaces
with ruin. In this, M. Kahn had not for a moment imagined
that he had exceeded the bounds of permissible opposition;
but on going down to Deux-Sèvres, to prepare for his re-election,
he had been informed by the prefect himself that he was
no longer the official candidate. He had lost favour, and the
minister had just nominated a Niort attorney, a man of most
mediocre abilities. This, of course, was a crushing blow.</p>

<p>Rougon was giving particulars of the matter, when
M. Kahn himself came into the room, followed by Du Poizat.
They had both arrived by the seven o'clock train, and had
only taken sufficient time to dine before coming on to
Rougon's.</p>

<p>'Well, what do you think of it?' said M. Kahn, standing
in the middle of the room, while everyone pressed round him.
'Fancy me being a revolutionist!'</p>

<p>Du Poizat had thrown himself into an easy chair with a
weary air. 'A nice campaign!' he cried. 'A pretty muddle!
It's enough to disgust all decent people!'</p>

<p>However, the company insisted upon M. Kahn telling them
the story in detail. He related that on his arrival in Deux-Sèvres
he had noticed a sort of embarrassment among even his
best friends. The prefect of the department, M. de Langlade,
was a man of dissolute character, whom he accused of paying
attentions to the wife of the new deputy, the Niort attorney.
However, this Langlade had told him of the disfavour into
which he had fallen in a kind enough fashion while they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
smoking their cigars after a breakfast at the prefecture. Then
M. Kahn repeated the conversation which had passed between
himself and M. de Langlade. The worst of the matter, said
he, was that his addresses and other bills were already being
printed. He had felt so indignant at first that he had been
inclined to stand all the same.</p>

<p>'Ah! if you hadn't written to us,' interposed Du Poizat,
turning to Rougon, 'we should have taught the government a
pretty lesson!'</p>

<p>Rougon shrugged his shoulders. 'You would have failed,
and have compromised yourselves for ever,' said he, as he
shuffled his cards. 'That would have been a fine feat!'</p>

<p>'I don't know what you're made of!' retorted Du Poizat,
jumping up with a gesture of indignation. 'For my part,
that fellow Marsy is getting past all bearing. It was you
that he was aiming at when he struck our friend Kahn.
Have you seen his circulars to the prefects? A pretty business
his elections have been! He settled them all with bits
of rhetoric! Don't smile! If you had been Minister of the
Interior, you would have managed matters in a very different
fashion.'</p>

<p>Then, seeing that Rougon still smiled as he looked at him,
he added yet more violently: 'We were on the spot and saw
the whole business. One unlucky fellow, an old comrade of
mine, had the temerity to come forward as a Republican
candidate. You can't imagine the abominable way in which
he was treated. The prefect, the mayors, the gendarmes, the
whole clique, fell foul of him. They defaced and tore his
bills and threw his bulletins into the ditches; they arrested
the few poor devils who distributed his circulars; and they
couldn't even leave his poor aunt alone, a most estimable
woman, who was obliged to beg him not to come to her house
any more, as he only compromised her. And as for the newspapers,
they spoke of him as though he were a cut-throat,
and now, whenever he passes through a village, all the women
cross themselves.'</p>

<p>Du Poizat noisily drew breath, then flung himself into his
chair again and continued: 'Well, although Marsy has got a
majority in all the departments, Paris at any rate has returned
five opposition deputies. That's the awakening. If the
Emperor goes on leaving power in the hands of that big
coxcomb of a minister and those wanton prefects, who send
husbands off to the Chamber so that they may make love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
their wives, why, in five years from now the Empire will be
on the verge of ruin. For my part, I'm delighted with the
elections in Paris. They have avenged us, I think.'</p>

<p>'So, if you had been a prefect——' began Rougon quietly,
with such a slight touch of irony that his thick lips barely
curled.</p>

<p>Du Poizat showed his irregular white teeth, and grasped
the arms of his chair with his frail, delicate hands as
though he wished to twist them. 'Oh!' said he, 'if I
had been prefect——' But he did not finish. He again fell
back in his chair, and exclaimed: 'It's getting quite sickening.
Besides, in reality, I have always been a Republican.'</p>

<p>The ladies by the window had now turned their heads
towards the others, and were listening to what was being
said. M. d'Escorailles held a large fan, with which he was
fanning pretty Madame Bouchard, who looked quite overcome
by the heat. The colonel and M. Bouchard, who had just
commenced a fresh game, ceased playing every now and then
to express their approval or disapproval of what was being
said by nodding or shaking their heads. A wide circle of
chairs had been drawn up around Rougon. Clorinde, listening
attentively with her chin resting upon her hand, did not
venture even on a gesture. Delestang, dwelling upon some
tender recollection, sat smiling at his wife; while M. Béjuin,
with his hands clasped on his knees, looked at the ladies and
gentlemen in succession with a scared face. The sudden
arrival of Du Poizat and M. Kahn had stirred up a perfect
storm in the quiet drawing-room. They seemed to have
brought with them an odour of opposition.</p>

<p>'Well, in the end I followed your advice and retired,'
resumed M. Kahn. 'I was warned that if I persisted I should
receive even worse treatment than the Republican candidate—I
who have served the Empire with such devotion! You
must admit that such ingratitude is enough to damp the enthusiasm
of the firmest supporters.'</p>

<p>Then he bitterly complained of a whole string of annoyances
and vexations. He had been anxious to start a newspaper
which should support his scheme of a railway line from
Niort to Angers, and which later on would have become a
very useful financial weapon in his hands; but he had been
refused the necessary authorisation. M. de Marsy had suspected
that Rougon was behind him, and that the proposed
journal would be used for attacking his administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>'They are afraid lest some one should at last write the
truth about them,' said Du Poizat. 'Ah! I would have furnished
you with some sweet articles! It is disgraceful to
have such a press as we have, gagged and threatened with
suppression at the first word of complaint it dares to print.
A friend of mine, who is bringing out a novel serially, was
recently summoned to the Ministry, where a head clerk
requested him to change the colour of his hero's waistcoat,
as the colour he had assigned to it was distasteful to the
minister. Oh! it's perfectly true. It's no invention.'</p>

<p>He cited other facts, and told them of terrible stories which
circulated among the people; of the suicides of a young
actress and a relation of the Emperor's, and of an alleged
duel between two generals, one of whom had killed the other,
in one of the corridors of the Tuileries, as the outcome of
some story of robbery.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> 'Would such stories ever have found
any credence if the press had been allowed to speak freely?'
asked Du Poizat; and he added: 'I am a Republican,
decidedly I am.'</p>

<p>'You are very fortunate,' remarked M. Kahn; 'I no
longer know what I am.'</p>

<p>Rougon, bending his broad shoulders, had just then commenced
a very elaborate <i>réussite</i>. His aim, after dealing his
thirty-two cards three times, first into seven heaps, then into
five, and finally into three, was to bring the eight clubs
together. He seemed completely absorbed in what he was
doing, still he pricked up his ears at certain words.</p>

<p>'The parliamentary system afforded us reliable guarantees,'
remarked the colonel. 'Ah! if we could only have the
princes back!'</p>

<p>When his fits of opposition were on, Colonel Jobelin was
an Orleanist. He often recounted the engagement of Mouzaïa,
when he had fought by the side of the Duc d'Aumale, at that
time a captain in the fourth regiment of the Line. 'We all
got on very well under Louis Philippe,' he continued, noticing
the silence with which his expression of regret was received.
'Don't you believe that, if we had a responsible cabinet, our
friend here would be at the head of the government within
six months?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Bouchard, however, showed signs of impatience. He
professed himself a Legitimist, probably because his grandfather
had had some connection with the Court in former
days. Thus, he and his cousin Jobelin often had heated
discussions upon politics. 'Nonsense!' he exclaimed, 'your
July monarchy only existed by dint of expedients. There is
only one real principle, as you know very well.'</p>

<p>Thereupon they began to get rather warm. They made a
clean sweep of the Empire, and each installed in its place
the government of his particular choice. Would the Orleans
family, cried Jobelin, have ever made the decoration of an old
soldier a matter of bargain? Would the Legitimist kings,
retorted Bouchard, ever have been guilty of such unjust
favouritism as was now to be seen every day in the government
offices? Thus they went on till they covertly alluded
to one another as fools, when all at once the colonel, angrily
picking up his cards, exclaimed: 'Make less noise, do you
hear, Bouchard, and please attend to the game!'</p>

<p>Delestang, whom the dispute had awakened from his
reverie, now felt bound to defend the Empire. Certainly,
said he, it was not everything that he could wish. He would
have liked a government of broader sympathies. And he
attempted to explain his aspirations, which embraced a somewhat
involved form of socialism, with such desiderata as the
extinction of pauperism and the co-operation of the working
classes, a system, in fact, much like that of his model farm
of Chamade, but on a large scale. While her husband spoke,
wagging his handsome head with an official air, Clorinde
kept her eyes on him, and slightly pouted.</p>

<p>'Yes, certainly I'm a Bonapartist,' he repeated; 'a
liberal Bonapartist, if you like.'</p>

<p>'And you, Béjuin?' M. Kahn suddenly inquired.</p>

<p>'Oh, I am one too,' replied M. Béjuin; 'there are shades
and distinctions of course, but I am certainly a Bonapartist.'</p>

<p>Du Poizat burst into a shrill laugh. 'Of course, you are!'
he exclaimed. And as they pressed him to explain himself,
he continued: 'Oh! you amuse me. You haven't been
turned out, you see. Delestang is still a member of the
Council of State, and Béjuin has just been re-elected.'</p>

<p>'That was a matter of course,' said Béjuin; 'the prefect
of the Cher—'</p>

<p>'Oh, you are not responsible, I don't accuse you. We all
know how these matters are worked. Combelot, too, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
re-elected, and La Rouquette also. So, of course, the Empire
is a magnificent institution!'</p>

<p>M. d'Escorailles, who was still fanning pretty Madame
Bouchard, now felt constrained to put in a word. He defended
the Empire from another point of view. He had adhered to
it, he said, because it seemed to him that the Emperor had a
grand mission to fulfil. 'The salvation of France before everything
else!'</p>

<p>'You have retained your berth as auditor, haven't you?'
asked Du Poizat, raising his voice. 'Well, then, there's no
difficulty in guessing your opinions. You all seem terribly
scandalised by what I'm saying; but it is a very simple
matter. Kahn and I, you see, are no longer paid to keep our
eyes shut.'</p>

<p>At this the others began to show a little temper. It was
disgraceful to take such a view of politics, they said. There
were other things besides personal interests to be considered.
Even the colonel and M. Bouchard, although they were not
Bonapartists themselves, admitted that a man might be a
Bonapartist in all good faith; and they waxed hot in support
of their own principles, as though an attempt was being made
to wrench them from them. As for Delestang, he seemed
much offended. He complained that he had been quite misunderstood,
and went on to point out how he differed from the
blind partisans of the Empire. This led him into fresh
explanations of the democratic developments which he thought
compatible with the Emperor's government. Then both M.
Béjuin and M. d'Escorailles objected to be looked upon as
Bonapartists pure and simple. They spoke of many different
shades of opinion, each clinging to his own particular, but
somewhat vaguely defined, views. And thus in ten minutes
or so the whole company had gone over to the opposition.
Voices rang out in dispute, and such terms as 'Legitimist,'
'Orleanist,' and 'Republican,' were bandied about amidst
repeated declarations of political faith. Madame Rougon
looked in at one of the doors for a moment, as if somewhat
uneasy, and then quietly disappeared again.</p>

<p>Rougon, however, had now just succeeded in getting his
clubs into proper sequence, whereupon Clorinde stooped and
asked him amidst the general uproar: 'Well, have you
managed it?'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' he replied, with his quiet smile. Then, as if
he had only just become aware of the war of words that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
going on, he shook his hand, remarking: 'You are making a
lot of noise.'</p>

<p>Thinking that he wanted to say something, the others
then ceased talking, and perfect silence ensued. However,
while they waited, Rougon simply spread thirteen cards upon
the table, reckoned them over, and finally, amidst general attention,
exclaimed: 'Three queens, the sign of a quarrel. A
dark woman, who is not to be trusted——'</p>

<p>But Du Poizat impatiently interrupted him. 'Well,
Rougon, and what is your opinion?'</p>

<p>The great man thereupon threw himself back in his chair
and stretched his legs, while raising his hand to his mouth to
conceal a slight yawn. And he raised his chin as though his
neck were paining him.</p>

<p>'Oh, I,' he said, with his eyes turned to the ceiling, 'I
believe in the principle of authority. It is a necessity with
me. It was born with me. It is very foolish of you to
wrangle. In France, whenever one gets five men together, it
is certain that five different kinds of government are represented.
But that doesn't prevent a man from loyally serving
the established government. That is so, is it not? You're
talking just for the sake of talking.'</p>

<p>Then he let his chin drop and glanced slowly round the
room, as he resumed: 'Marsy has managed the elections very
well. You did wrong to blame his circulars. The last one
was an extremely good one. And as for the press, I think
that it has too much liberty already. What kind of state
should we be in, if any one could write everything he liked?
I should have taken the same course as Marsy in refusing to
grant Kahn permission to start a newspaper. It is always
unwise to provide your opponents with weapons. Soft-hearted
Empires invariably come to grief. France requires an iron
hand, and is none the worse for being grasped a little tightly.'</p>

<p>Delestang felt bound to protest against this. 'But, at any
rate, there are certain necessary liberties——' he commenced.</p>

<p>Clorinde, however, made him stop. She had expressed
her approval of all Rougon had said by ostentatious nods.
She had even brought herself forward so that he might see
her better, submissive and convinced before him. And it was
at her that he cast a quick glance as he exclaimed: 'Oh, yes!
the necessary liberties! I was expecting that they would be
dragged in! Well, if the Emperor took my advice, he would
never grant a single liberty.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Then as Delestang again showed an inclination to protest,
his wife reduced him to silence by a threatening frown of her
beautiful brow.</p>

<p>'<i>Never</i>!' repeated Rougon energetically. And he sprang
from his chair and looked so formidable that no one ventured
to speak a word. Then, however, he dropped down again, and
his limbs seemed to grow limp as he muttered: 'You've made
me shout as well——However, I'm only a simple private
citizen now, and have no occasion to mix myself up in it all,
thank goodness. Heaven grant that the Emperor may have
no further occasion for my services!'</p>

<p>Just at that moment the door of the drawing-room was
opened, and Rougon, raising his finger to his mouth, added in
a whisper: 'Hush!'</p>

<p>It was M. La Rouquette who entered. Rougon suspected
that he came to the Rue Marbeuf at the instigation of his
sister, Madame de Llorentz, to spy upon what went on there.
M. de Marsy, although he had only been married six months,
had just renewed his intimacy with this lady, whose name
had been associated with his own for nearly two years. And
so as soon as the young deputy made his appearance, politics
were set aside and the drawing-room resumed its decorous
quietude. Rougon himself went to fetch a large shade which
he placed over the lamp, and then one saw only the withered
hands of the colonel and M. Bouchard throwing down their
cards in the circle of yellow light. At the window Madame
Charbonnel was now telling her troubles in a low voice to
Madame Correur, while M. Charbonnel punctuated each detail
with a deep sigh. They would soon have been two years in
Paris, the lady was saying sadly, and their wretched lawsuit
seemed as though it would never end. On the day before she
had been obliged to buy herself six new chemises and her
husband six new shirts, having learnt that the matter had
been again adjourned. Somewhat in the rear of this group,
near a curtain, was Madame Bouchard, who had apparently
dropped asleep, rendered drowsy by the heat. M. d'Escorailles
approached her again, and then, as no one was looking, he
had the calm impudence to print a kiss upon her half-closed
lips. At this, she opened her eyes, looking very solemn, but
she kept quite still.</p>

<p>'Oh dear, no!' M. La Rouquette was saying just at that
moment; 'I haven't been to the Variétés. I saw the full-dress
rehearsal of the piece. It's a tremendous success; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
music is wonderfully gay. It will draw all Paris. But to-day
I had some work to finish, something I am preparing.'</p>

<p>He had shaken hands with the men, and had gallantly
kissed Clorinde's wrist above her glove. And he remained
standing, smiling and leaning against the back of an arm-chair.
He was irreproachably dressed, and there was an
assumption of solemn gravity in the way in which his frock-coat
was buttoned up.</p>

<p>'By-the-bye,' he said, addressing himself to the master of
the house, '<i>à propos</i> of your great work, I should like to call
your attention to a most interesting paper on the English
constitution which has just appeared in a Vienna review. Are
you making progress?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm getting on very slowly,' Rougon replied. 'I
have got to a chapter which gives me a great deal of trouble.'</p>

<p>As a rule he delighted to make the young deputy talk,
for through him he learnt all that went on at the Tuileries.
He felt sure that La Rouquette had been sent to his house
that evening to find out what he thought about the success
of the official candidates, and he succeeded in worming a
large amount of information out of him, though he himself
did not make a remark that was worth repeating. He began
by congratulating the young man upon his own election, and
then kept up the conversation by occasional nods. La
Rouquette, who was fond of talking, rattled on without a
pause. The Court was delighted, he said. The Emperor
had learnt the result of the elections, at Plombières, and it
was said that on the arrival of the telegram he had been
obliged to sit down, as his legs gave way with emotion. But
there was one great source of uneasiness amidst the victory.
Paris had shown monstrous ingratitude.</p>

<p>'Pooh! Paris can be muzzled!' said Rougon, stifling
another yawn, as though bored at finding nothing of interest
in all M. La Rouquette's chatter.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock struck, and Madame Rougon, having placed
a small round table in the centre of the room, began to serve
the tea. The company scattered in little groups about the
room. M. Kahn was standing cup in hand in front of
Delestang, who never took tea because it affected his nerves,
and was giving him some additional particulars of his
journey to La Vendée. His great scheme for a railway from
Niort to Angers was no further advanced, he said. However,
that scamp of a Langlade, the prefect of Deux-Sèvres, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
audaciously availed himself of it to influence the constituency
in favour of the new official candidate.</p>

<p>Meantime. M. La Rouquette, who had slipped behind the
ladies, was whispering remarks which made them smile;
while Madame Correur, screened by a rampart of chairs,
talked somewhat excitedly to Du Poizat. She asked him
about her brother Martineau, the notary at Coulonges, and the
other told her that he had seen him for a moment in front
of the church, looking just the same as ever, with his hard
face and solemn air. Then, as she started on her usual recriminations,
he mischievously advised her never to go home
again, as Madame Martineau had sworn she would fling her
out of doors. Madame Correur finished her tea, feeling quite
choked.</p>

<p>'Come, my children, it's time to go to bed,' said Rougon
paternally.</p>

<p>It was now twenty-five minutes past ten, and he gave
them five minutes longer. Some of the company, however,
withdrew at once. Rougon went to the door with M. Kahn
and M. Béjuin, whom Madame Rougon invariably charged
with compliments for their wives, though she saw the ladies
twice a year at the utmost. Then Rougon gently pushed the
Charbonnels towards the door. They were always greatly
embarrassed about taking their leave. And afterwards, as
pretty Madame Bouchard was going off between M.
d'Escorailles and M. La Rouquette, he turned to the card-table
and exclaimed: 'Come, Monsieur Bouchard, they are
carrying off your wife!'</p>

<p>But the chief-clerk, without appearing to hear, went on
calling out his points: 'A major quint in clubs! That's
good, eh? Three kings; they are good too.'</p>

<p>However, Rougon gathered up the cards. 'Come, you've
had enough!' said he. 'Get away home with you. You
ought to be ashamed of yourselves for getting so excited over
it. Come, colonel, come.'</p>

<p>It was just the same every Thursday and Sunday. He
had to stop them in the middle of a game, and sometimes
even turn the lamp out before they would give up their play.
And they went off, disputing with each other.</p>

<p>Delestang and Clorinde were the last to go, and while her
husband was hunting about the room for her fan, the young
woman said to Rougon in an undertone: 'It is foolish of you
not to take a little exercise; you will make yourself ill.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>However he made a gesture of indifference and resignation:
Madame Rougon was already gathering together the
cups and teaspoons. Then as Delestang shook hands with
him, the great man frankly yawned in his face. In order,
however, that they might not think his evening had bored
him, he excused himself by saying: 'Ah! dash it, I shall
sleep well to-night.'</p>

<p>The evenings always passed away in this manner. There
was a sombre atmosphere about the room, and Du Poizat
even said that 'it smelt too much of cant.' Clorinde called
very frequently. She often came by herself in the afternoon
to fulfil some commission with which she had charged
herself. She would playfully tell Madame Rougon that she
had come to make love to her husband, and the wife, with a
smile on her pale lips, would leave them together for hours
at a time. They conversed familiarly, without appearing to
recollect the past, exchanging friendly grasps of the hand
in the very room where but a year before Rougon had paced
up and down, so restless with passion. But they seemed to
have forgotten all that, and gave themselves up to quiet
friendship. Rougon would push back the young woman's
straying hair, which always seemed to be blowing loose, or
help her with the train of her dress, which was invariably
very long and apt to become entangled among the chairs.
One day, as they went through the garden, she had the
curiosity to push the stable-door open. She even entered,
giving a glance at Rougon and laughing lightly. But he
merely remarked with a smile, as he stood with his hands in
his pockets: 'How foolish people can be sometimes!'</p>

<p>Whenever she came to see him, he always gave her good
advice. He spoke much in favour of Delestang, who, on the
whole, made a very good husband. Clorinde said that she
had great esteem for him, and he did not appear to have any
cause of complaint against her. She said that she never
flirted, and this was quite true. Her slightest remarks
seemed tinged with indifference, almost with contempt, for
men. When any one spoke of a woman with more lovers
than could be counted, an expression of surprise would come
into her big child-like eyes, and she would ask what pleasure
any one could find in such conduct. For weeks together she
seemed unconscious of her beauty, and only recollected it in
some emergency, when she availed herself of it as a weapon.
One day when Rougon, who harped upon the subject with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
singular pertinacity, was advising her to keep faithful to
Delestang, she ended by getting angry and exclaiming: 'Oh,
leave me alone. I'm quite aware of all you're saying. Really,
you are becoming offensive.' And on another day she added
bluntly: 'After all, it is no concern of yours.'</p>

<p>Rougon blushed, and for some time afterwards said nothing
more on the subject of her duties and the proprieties. A
persistent thrill of jealousy was all that now remained to
him of his old passion. He watched her in the drawing-rooms
which she frequented; and, if he had scented any
intrigue, he would probably have warned her husband. As
a matter of fact, when he was alone with the latter, he did
try to put him on his guard, by speaking of his wife's extraordinary
beauty. But Delestang always laughed with an air
of fatuous confidence, and it was Rougon who really endured
all the jealous torments of a betrayed husband.</p>

<p>His other counsels, practical ones, testified to his great
affection for Clorinde. It was he who by degrees persuaded
her to send her mother back to Italy. Countess Balbi, left
alone in her little house in the Champs Élysées, had begun
to lead a careless life which gave rise to much talk. Rougon
took upon himself to settle the delicate question of an allowance.
The house was next sold, and thus the young woman's
past was wiped out. Then Rougon tried to cure her of her
eccentricities, but in this matter he found himself confronted
by utter <i>naïveté</i> and resolute feminine obstinacy. Clorinde,
now that she was married and wealthy, squandered money
lavishly, though she was subject to sudden impulses of sordid
avarice. She had kept her little maid, the dusky Antonia,
who sucked oranges from morning till night; and between
them they made an abominable mess of Clorinde's rooms in
the big house in the Rue du Colisée. When Rougon went
to see the young woman, he would find dirty plates on the
chairs, and bottles of syrup strewn along the floor beside the
wall. Beneath the furniture too he could espy an untidy
accumulation of things which had been hastily thrust out of
sight when he was announced.</p>

<p>And amidst the greasy hangings and soiled, dusty wood-work,
Clorinde still indulged in the most extraordinary
caprices. She would often receive her friends wrapt round
with a rug, and lying on a couch, while complaining of the
strangest disorders—of a dog, for instance, which was gnawing
at her foot, or of a pin which she had accidentally swallowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and the point of which must be trying to force its way out
through her leg. At other times she would close the shutters
at three o'clock in the afternoon, light all the candles, and
begin to dance with Antonia, the one facing the other, and
indulging in such paroxysms of laughter that when Rougon
arrived the maid had to stand panting by the door for five
minutes before she could leave the room. One day too
Clorinde determined to remain invisible; she sewed her bed
curtains together from top to bottom; and sat up on the
bolster inside the cage she had thus formed, talking to
Rougon for more than an hour, as calmly as though they
had been sitting on either side of the fire. These extravagancies
seemed quite natural to her. When Rougon chided
her for them, she appeared quite surprised, and declared that
she was doing nothing improper. It was in vain that he
preached propriety to her, and promised to make her the
most fascinating woman in Paris in a month's time, if she
would let herself be guided by him; she only grew angry,
and exclaimed: 'It's my nature to be like this; I always go
on like this. What harm does it do anybody?' And sometimes
she would smile and say: 'Oh, well, people love me
all the same! Don't preach!'</p>

<p>Delestang, indeed, worshipped her. To him she was
quite unlike a wife, but for that very reason exercised the
more influence. He shut his eyes to her caprices, smitten
with a terrible fear lest she should leave him, as she had one
day threatened to do. Beneath his meek submission there
was probably a feeling that she was his superior, well able to
do whatever she liked with him. In society he treated her
almost like a child, and spoke to her with the complacency
of a serious man. But when they were by themselves, this
handsome fellow, with the haughty head, would burst into
tears if she would not let him kiss her. The only check he
put upon her was to take possession of the keys of the first
floor rooms, in order that the reception apartments might be
kept free from grease and dirt.</p>

<p>Rougon, though he failed in some things, managed to
induce Clorinde to dress a little more like other people. With
all her failings she was very shrewd, with the shrewdness of
those lunatics who in lucid intervals manage to appear perfectly
rational before strangers. He met her at certain houses,
looking very demure and reserved, allowing her husband to
do all the talking, and remaining quite decorous amidst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
admiration excited by her beauty. At her own house,
Rougon frequently found M. de Plouguern, and Clorinde
would sit between them making playful remarks, while they
poured forth moral disquisitions for her benefit. Sometimes
the old senator would familiarly pat the girl's cheeks, much
to Rougon's annoyance, though he never ventured to express
what he thought on the subject. He was more courageous
with regard to Luigi Pozzo, Chevalier Rusconi's secretary,
whom he had frequently noticed leaving the house at unusual
hours. When he hinted to the young woman that this might
compromise her very seriously, she raised her eyes with a
pretty look of surprise, and burst out laughing. She didn't
care for what people thought, she cried. Besides, Luigi
counted for nothing. He was her cousin, and he brought her
little Milanese cakes, which he purchased for her in the
Passage Colbert.</p>

<p>It was with politics, however, that Clorinde's mind was
chiefly occupied. Since she had married Delestang, her brain
had been busy with deep and intricate matters, of which no
one knew the importance. She found in them, however, a
means of satisfying her craving for intrigue, which had so
long found scope in her attempts to ensnare those whom she
thought to be coming men; and she seemed to be preparing
herself in this way for some yet greater schemes which she
had in contemplation. She kept up a regular correspondence
with her mother, who was now settled at Turin; and went
almost every day to the Sardinian legation, where Chevalier
Rusconi took her apart, and talked to her in low tones. Then
too she went on mysterious errands to all parts of Paris,
making furtive visits to great personages, and keeping
appointments in the most out-of-the-way places. All the
Venetian refugees, the Brambillas, and the Staderinos, and
the Viscardis, came to see her secretly, and gave her scraps
of paper covered with memoranda. She had bought a large
red morocco case, a genuine ministerial portfolio with a steel
lock, and in it she stowed away a wonderful collection of
documents. When she drove out, she kept it on her knees
like a muff; and wherever she called she carried it about with
her under her arm; and she might even be met early in the
morning, on foot, clasping it against her breast with both her
hands. The case soon began to look worn, and it split at
the seams. Then she buckled straps round it. And ever
laden as she was with this shapeless leather case bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
with papers, she looked like some money-grubbing solicitor
running from one police-court to another in the hope of
picking up a petty fee.</p>

<p>Rougon had made several attempts to discover what it
was that so engrossed Clorinde's thoughts. One day when
he was left alone for a few moments with her famous portfolio,
he had not scrupled to pull out some letters which protruded
through its gaps. But all that he could find out in
one fashion or another seemed to him so incoherent and disconnected
that he smiled at the young woman's pretensions
to politics. One afternoon, however, she quietly began to
expound to him a vast scheme. She was working to bring
about an alliance between France and Italy, in view of a
speedy campaign against Austria. Rougon, who for a moment
was very much struck by this, ended by shrugging his shoulders
at the heap of absurdities which found place in her
plan. He had in no way modified his opinion about women.
Clorinde, on her side, so far as he was concerned, seemed to
accept the subordinate position of a disciple quite willingly.
When she went to see him in the Rue Marbeuf, she assumed
an air of submissive humility, and questioned him, and
listened to him with the eagerness of a neophyte anxious
for instruction. For his part, he frequently forgot to whom
he was speaking, and unfolded his theory of government, and
talked to her in the most unrestrained and confidential
manner. In fact, their conversations gradually became a
regular habit, and he made her his confidante, breaking the
silence which he observed in the presence of his best friends,
and treating her like a discreet pupil, whose respectful admiration
had a great charm for him.</p>

<p>During the months of August and September, Clorinde
increased the frequency of her visits. She would call on
Rougon three or four times a week, and never had she shown
herself so gentle and affectionate. She paid him the most
flattering compliments, eulogised his genius, and spoke
regretfully of the great things which he would have accomplished
if he had not retired. One day, as an idea flashed
through his mind, he said to her with a laugh: 'There's
something you want me to do for you?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she replied candidly.</p>

<p>But she quickly reassumed her expression of admiring
wonder. Politics were much more interesting than novels,
she declared. However, whenever Rougon turned his back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
for a moment, she would open her eyes quite widely, and a
momentary gleam would flash from them, suggesting some old
feeling of bitterness which still lived on. She often let her
hands linger in his, as though she still felt too weak for what
she was contemplating, and was waiting till she had drained
away sufficient of his strength to be able to throttle him.</p>

<p>However, his increasing lassitude at this juncture was
really a source of much uneasiness to her. He seemed to be
falling fast asleep amidst his boredom. She had made, at
first, full allowance for all possible pretence which there
might be in his demeanour, but was at length forced to
believe that he really did feel discouraged. His movements
had grown sluggish, and his voice languid; and sometimes
he seemed so listless and indifferent that the young
woman felt quite alarmed, and seriously wondered if he were
not going to abide by his relegation to the Senate as a played-out
politician.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September, however, Rougon seemed
very thoughtful. At last, in one of his customary conversations
with Clorinde, he told her that he was maturing a great
scheme. He was growing weary of Paris, and needed fresh
air. Then all at once he spoke out. It was a great scheme
of an altogether fresh life: a voluntary exile to the Landes of
Gascony, the clearing of several square leagues of ground,
and the founding of a new town amidst the conquered
territory. Clorinde turned quite pale as she listened to him.</p>

<p>'But your position here!' she cried; 'your prospects!'</p>

<p>'Bah! castles in the air!' he said disdainfully. 'I have
come to the conclusion that I am not cut out for politics.'</p>

<p>Then he reverted to his pet idea of being a great landowner,
with herds of cattle which he would rule in all
sovereignty. But his ambition was now greater. In the
Landes of Gascony he would be like the conquering king of
a new territory. He would have a people under him. He
gave Clorinde all kinds of particulars. For the last fortnight,
without saying a word to anyone, he had been reading technical
treatises. And in imagination he had been reclaiming
marshes, clearing the soil of stones with the aid of powerful
machines, checking the advance of the sandhills by plantations
of pines, and dowering France with a tract of wondrously
fertile country. All his dormant activity, all his latent giant's
strength, awoke within him at the thought of this undertaking.
He clenched his fists as though he were already face to face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
with rebellious rocks. In imagination he turned the whole
soil over at a single stroke; carried houses completely built
on his shoulders, and dropped them as his fancy listed on the
banks of some river, whose bed he had hollowed out by a
single kick of his foot. It all seemed so easy, and it would
give him the work he so much desired. The Emperor, no
doubt, still retained sufficient good-will towards him to let
him reclaim those waste lands. And erect, bracing up his
big form, and with his cheeks aglow, he burst into a proud
laugh: 'It is a magnificent idea!' he cried. 'I shall give
my name to the town, and I, too, shall found a little
Empire!'</p>

<p>Clorinde imagined that it was all a mere caprice, a whim
born of the boredom in which he was struggling. But when
they subsequently met, Rougon again spoke of his scheme
with even greater enthusiasm than before. Each time she
came to see him, she found him amidst a litter of maps
strewn over the desk, the chairs, and the carpet alike. One
afternoon she was not able to see him, as he was conferring
with two engineers. Thereupon she began to feel really
alarmed. Could he really mean to give her the slip like that
and go off and found this town of his in the wilderness?
Wasn't it rather some new stratagem he was arranging?
However, she relinquished her endeavours to ascertain the
truth, and thought it best to give the alarm to the whole
band.</p>

<p>There was great consternation. Du Poizat flew into a
passion. For more than a year now he had been living by
shifts, and on his last journey to La Vendée his father had
hastily taken a pistol from a drawer on his venturing to ask
him for ten thousand francs to float a magnificent speculation.
So now the ex-sub-prefect was half-starving again
just as in 1848. M. Kahn showed equal anger. His blast-furnaces
at Bressuire were being threatened with speedy ruin,
and he felt that he would be lost if he could not obtain the
railway grant within the next six months. All the others,
M. Béjuin, the colonel, the Bouchards, and the Charbonnels,
were similarly upset. Things could not possibly be allowed
to end like that, they cried. Really, such conduct on Rougon's
part was not reasonable. They must talk to him about it.</p>

<p>A fortnight, however, went by. Clorinde, whose ideas
were approved by the whole band, had come to the conclusion
that it would be hazardous to make an open attack on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
great man. They must wait for a fitting opportunity. This
they did, and one Sunday evening, towards the middle of
October, when they were all assembled in the drawing-room
in the Rue Marbeuf, Rougon smilingly remarked to them:
'You'd never guess what I received to-day.'</p>

<p>Then he took a pink card from behind the timepiece and
showed it to them. 'An invitation to Compiègne, from the
Emperor,' he said.</p>

<p>At this moment his valet quietly opened the door, and
told him that the gentleman he was expecting had arrived.
Rougon excused himself and left the room. Clorinde had
risen to her feet and stood there listening. Then, as silence
fell, she exclaimed, energetically: 'He must go to Compiègne!'</p>

<p>The friends glanced round suspiciously; but they were
quite alone. Madame Rougon had gone off some minutes
previously. And so in low voices, and with their eyes fixed
on the doors, they began to speak their minds. The ladies
were gathered in a circle in front of the fire-place, where a
huge log was smouldering. M. Bouchard and the colonel
were busy with their everlasting piquet, while the other men
had wheeled their chairs into a corner to isolate themselves.
Clorinde alone remained standing in the middle of the room,
her head bent as if deep in thought.</p>

<p>'He was expecting somebody, then?' began Du Poizat.
'Who can it be, I wonder?'</p>

<p>The others shrugged their shoulders, as if to say that they
did not know.</p>

<p>'Something to do with this idiotic scheme of his, perhaps,'
continued the ex-sub-prefect. 'One of these evenings, you'll
see, I shall tell him plainly what I think of him.'</p>

<p>'Hush!' exclaimed M. Kahn, raising his finger to his
lips.</p>

<p>Du Poizat had raised his voice in an alarming way. For
a moment they all strained their ears to listen. Then M.
Kahn himself said in a very low tone: 'There is no doubt but
what he has pledged himself to us.'</p>

<p>'Say, rather, that he has contracted a debt,' interposed the
colonel, laying down his cards.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; a debt; that is the word,' declared M.
Bouchard. 'We didn't mince matters that last day at the
Council of State.'</p>

<p>All the others nodded assent. There was a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
lamentation. Rougon had ruined them. M. Bouchard added,
that if it had not been for his fidelity, he would have got
his promotion long ago; and, to hear the colonel talk, anyone
would have imagined that he had been offered a commander's
cross, and a post for his son Auguste, on the part of M.
de Marsy, and that he had simply refused them out of
friendship for Rougon. M. d'Escorailles' parents, said pretty
Madame Bouchard, were much disappointed at seeing their
son remain a mere auditor when for the last six months they
had been expecting his promotion to higher rank. Even
those who said nothing, Delestang, M. Béjuin, Madame
Correur, and the Charbonnels, bit their lips and raised their
eyes to heaven with the expression of martyrs whose patience
was at last beginning to fail them.</p>

<p>'Well, the long and the short of it is that we are being
defrauded,' cried Du Poizat. 'But he shall not go away; I
answer for that! Is there any sense in a man setting off and
struggling with stones when there are such serious interests
to keep him in Paris? Are you willing that I should speak
to him?'</p>

<p>Clorinde now awoke from her reverie. She waved her
hand to obtain silence; and after opening the door to see
that there was no one outside, she repeated: 'I tell you that
he must go to Compiègne!'</p>

<p>Then, as every face turned towards her, she checked all
questions with another wave of her hand: 'Hush! not
here!'</p>

<p>She told them, however, that she and her husband had
also been invited to Compiègne, and she made some mention
of M. de Marsy and Madame de Llorentz without consenting
to enter into further details. However, they would push the
great man into power in spite of himself, she said; they would
compromise him, if he drove them to it. M. Beulin-d'Orchère
and the whole judicial bench secretly supported him; and
M. La Rouquette had confessed that the Emperor, amidst all
the hatred expressed against Rougon by those who surrounded
him, had kept absolute silence on the matter. Whenever the
great man's name was mentioned in his presence, he became
serious and lowered his eyes.</p>

<p>'It is not we alone who are concerned,' M. Kahn now
declared. 'If we succeed, the whole country will owe us
thanks.'</p>

<p>Then, raising their voices, they all began to sing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
praises of the master of the house. A buzz of conversation
in an adjoining room had just become audible. Du Poizat
was so carried away by curiosity, that he pushed the door
open as though he were going out, and then closed it again
with sufficient deliberation to take a look at the man who was
speaking with Rougon. It was Gilquin, wearing a heavy
overcoat in good condition, and holding in his hand a stout
cane with a knob of yellow metal. He was saying in his full
voice, with exaggerated familiarity: 'Don't send any more,
you understand, to the Rue Virginie at Grenelle. I'm at
Batignolles now, Passage Guttin. Well, you can reckon upon
me. Good-bye for the present.'</p>

<p>Then he shook hands with Rougon.</p>

<p>When the latter returned to the drawing-room he apologised
for his absence, but gave Du Poizat a keen glance: 'A
good fellow, whom you know, Du Poizat, don't you?' said
he. 'He is going to enlist some colonists for my new world
in the Landes. By the way, I mean to take you all with me;
so you had better get your things together. Kahn shall be
my Prime Minister. Delestang and his wife shall have the
portfolio of Foreign Affairs. Béjuin shall be Postmaster.
And I won't forget the ladies. Madame Bouchard shall be
Queen of Beauty, and I'll give the keys of our store-rooms to
Madame Charbonnel.'</p>

<p>In this wise he playfully rattled on, while his friends, very
ill at ease, were wondering if he had perchance heard them
through some chink or other. When he proceeded to say
that he would decorate the colonel with all the orders in his
gift, the latter almost lost his temper. Clorinde, however,
was looking at the invitation to Compiègne which she had
taken from off the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>'Do you mean to go?' she asked, with an appearance of
unconcern.</p>

<p>'Oh, no doubt,' replied Rougon, surprised at the question.
'I mean to take advantage of the opportunity to get the
Emperor to give me my department.'</p>

<p>Just then ten o'clock struck, and Madame Rougon returned
to the room and served tea.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a></h3>

<h3>AT COURT</h3>


<p>Towards seven o'clock on the evening of her arrival at
Compiègne, Clorinde was engaged in conversation with M. de
Plouguern near one of the windows in the Gallery of the
Maps. They were waiting for the Emperor and Empress
before entering the dining-room. The second batch of the
season's guests had scarcely been more than three hours at
the château, and all of them had not yet come down from
their rooms. Clorinde occupied herself by briefly criticising
them as they entered the gallery, one by one. The ladies, in
low dresses, and wearing flowers in their hair, put on smiles
as soon as they reached the threshold; while the gentlemen,
wearing white cravats, black knee-breeches, and silk stockings,
preserved a solemn air.</p>

<p>'Ah; here comes the Chevalier!' muttered Clorinde.
'He looks very nice, doesn't he? But just look at M. Beulin-d'Orchère,
godfather! Doesn't he look as though he were
going to bark? And, good heavens, what legs!'</p>

<p>M. de Plouguern began to grin, much amused by this
backbiting. Chevalier Rusconi came up and bowed to
Clorinde, with the languid gallantry of a handsome Italian;
then he made the round of the ladies, swaying to and fro with
a series of gentle rhythmical reverences. A few yards away,
Delestang, looking very serious, was examining the huge maps
of the Forest of Compiègne, which covered the walls of the
gallery.</p>

<p>'Whereabouts in the train were you?' Clorinde continued.
'I looked out for you at the station, so that we might travel
together. Just fancy, I was squeezed up with a whole crowd
of men.' Then she stopped, and stifled a laugh with her
fingers. 'How demure Monsieur La Rouquette looks!' said
she.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed; he's like a simpering schoolgirl,' rejoined
the senator sarcastically.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a loud rustling was heard by the
door, which was thrown wide open to admit a lady wearing a
dress which was so lavishly adorned with bows and flowers
and lace, that she had to press it down with both hands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
order to get through. It was Madame de Combelot, Clorinde's
sister-in-law. The latter stared at her, and murmured:
'Good gracious!'</p>

<p>Then, as M. de Plouguern glanced at her own dress of
simple tarlatan, worn over an ill-cut under-skirt of rose-silk,
she continued, with an air of complete unconcern: 'Ah! I
don't care about dress, godfather! People must take me, you
know, as I am.'</p>

<p>Delestang, however, had quitted the maps, and after joining
his sister, led her to his wife. The two women were not
particularly fond of each other, and exchanged rather stiff
greetings. Then Madame de Combelot walked off, dragging
her satin train, which looked like a strip of flower garden,
through the clusters of silent men, who stepped back out of
the way of this flood of lace flounces. Clorinde, as soon as
she was alone again with M. de Plouguern, referred playfully
to the lady's great passion for the Emperor. And when the
old senator had told her that there was no reciprocal feeling
on the Emperor's part, she continued: 'Well, there's no great
merit in that; she's so dreadfully lean. I have been told
that some men consider her good-looking, but I don't know
why. She has absolutely no figure at all.'</p>

<p>While talking in this strain, Clorinde none the less kept
her eyes upon the door. 'Ah! this time it must surely be
Monsieur Rougon,' she said as it opened again. But, almost
immediately, she resumed with a flash in her eyes: 'Ah, no!
it is Monsieur de Marsy.'</p>

<p>The minister, looking quite irreproachable in his black
dress-coat and knee-breeches, stepped up to Madame de
Combelot with a smile, and while he was paying compliments
to her, he glanced round at the assembled guests, blinking
his eyes as though he recognised no one. But, as they began
to bow to him, he inclined his head with an expression of
great amiability. Several men approached him, and he soon
became the centre of a group. His pale face, with its subtle
cunning air, towered over the shoulders clustering round
him.</p>

<p>'By the way,' said Clorinde, pushing M. de Plouguern into
a window-recess, 'I have been relying upon you for some
information. What do you know about Madame de Llorentz's
famous letters?'</p>

<p>'Only what all the world knows,' replied the old senator.</p>

<p>Then he began to speak of the famous three letters which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
had been written, it was said, by Count de Marsy to Madame
de Llorentz nearly five years previously, a short time before
the Emperor's marriage. Madame de Llorentz, who had just
lost her husband, a general of Spanish origin, was then at
Madrid, looking after her deceased husband's affairs. It was
the heyday of her connection with Marsy, who, to amuse her,
and yielding to his own sportive proclivities, had sent her
some very piquant details concerning certain august personages
with whom he was living on intimate terms. And it was
asserted that Madame de Llorentz, who was an extremely
jealous beauty, had carefully preserved these letters, and kept
them hanging over M. de Marsy's head as an ever-ready
means of vengeance, should he presume to wander in his
affections.</p>

<p>'She allowed herself to be talked over,' continued M. de
Plouguern, 'when Marsy had to marry the Wallachian
princess; but, after consenting to their spending a
month's honeymoon together, she gave him to understand that
if he did not return to her feet, she would some day lay the
three terrible letters on the Emperor's desk. So he has
taken up his fetters again, and lavishes the most loving
attention upon her in the hope that he may get her to give
these letters up.'</p>

<p>Clorinde laughed heartily; the story amused her, and she
began to ask all sorts of questions. If the Count should
deceive Madame de Llorentz, would she really carry her threat
into execution? Where did she keep those letters? Was it
really in the bosom of her dress, stitched between two pieces
of satin ribbon, as some people said? M. de Plouguern,
however, could give no further information. No one but
Madame de Llorentz herself had ever read the letters; but he
knew a young man who had vainly made himself her humble
slave for nearly six months in the hope of being able to get a
copy of them.</p>

<p>'But look at Marsy,' he continued, 'he never takes his
eyes off you. Ah! I had forgotten; you have made a conquest
of him. Is it true that, at the last soirée at the ministry, he
remained talking to you for nearly an hour?'</p>

<p>The young woman made no reply. Indeed she was not
listening, but stood majestic and motionless under M. de
Marsy's steady gaze. Then slowly raising her head and
looking at him in her turn, she waited for him to bow to her.
He thereupon stepped up, and she smiled upon him very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
sweetly. They did not, however, exchange a word. The Count
went back to the group he had left, in which M. La Rouquette
now was talking very loudly, perpetually speaking of him as
'His Excellency.'</p>

<p>The gallery had gradually filled. There were nearly a
hundred persons present: high functionaries, generals, foreign
diplomatists, five deputies, three prefects, two painters, a
novelist, and a couple of academicians, to say nothing of the
court officials, the chamberlains, and the aides-de-camp and
equerries. A subdued murmur of voices arose amid the glare
of the chandeliers. Those who were familiar with the château
paced slowly up and down, while those who had been asked
there for the first time remained where they stood, too timid
to venture among the ladies. The want of ease which for
the first hour or so prevailed among these guests, many of
whom were unacquainted with one another, but who found
themselves suddenly assembled in the ante-chamber of the
Imperial dining-room, gave to their faces an expression of
sullen reserve. Every now and then there were sudden
intervals of silence, and heads turned anxiously round. The
very furniture of the spacious apartment, the pier tables with
straight legs, and the square chairs, all in the stiff First Empire
style, seemed to impart additional solemnity to this spell of
waiting.</p>

<p>'Here he comes at last!' murmured Clorinde.</p>

<p>Rougon had just entered and stood still for a moment,
blinking. He had donned his expression of good natured
simplicity; his back was slightly bent, and his face had a
sleepy look. He noticed at a glance the faint tremor of
hostility which thrilled some of the guests at his appearance.
However, in quiet fashion, shaking hands here and there, he
steered his way so as to come face to face with M. de Marsy.
They bowed to one another, and seemed delighted to meet;
and they began to talk in very friendly fashion, though they
kept their eyes on each other like foes who respected each
other's strength. An empty space had been cleared around
them. The ladies watched their slightest gestures with
interest; while the men, affecting great discretion, pretended
to look in another direction, though every now and then they
cast furtive glances at them. Much whispering went on in
different corners of the room. What secret plan had the
Emperor got in his head? Why had he brought those two
men together? M. La Rouquette felt sorely perplexed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
fancied he could scent some very grave business. So he went
up to M. de Plouguern, and began to question him. But the
old senator gave rein to his jocosity. 'Oh,' said he, 'perhaps
Rougon is going to upset Marsy, so it is as well to treat him
deferentially. On the other hand, perhaps the Emperor
merely wanted to see them together, in the hope that something
amusing might happen.'</p>

<p>However, the whispering ceased, and there was a general
stir. Two officers of the household went from group to group
saying something in low tones. Then the guests, who had
suddenly become serious again, made their way towards the
door on the left, where they formed themselves into a double
line, the men on one side and the ladies on the other. M. de
Marsy posted himself near the door, keeping Rougon by his
side; and the rest of the company ranged themselves in the
order of their rank. Then, keeping perfect silence, they continued
waiting for another three minutes.</p>

<p>At last the folding-doors were thrown wide open. The
Emperor, in full dress, and wearing the red ribbon of the
Legion of Honour across his chest, came into the room first,
followed by the chamberlain on duty, M. de Combelot. He
smiled slightly as he stopped before M. de Marsy and Rougon,
swaying slightly, and slowly twisting his long moustache, as,
in an embarrassed tone, he said: 'You must tell Madame
Rougon how extremely sorry we were to hear that she was ill.
We should have much liked to see her here with you. We must
hope that she will very soon be well again. There are a great
many colds about just now.'</p>

<p>Then he passed on. After taking a few steps, however, he
stopped to shake hands with a general, asking him after his
son, whom he called 'my little friend Gaston.' Gaston was
of the same age as the Prince Imperial, but was already much
more vigorous. The guests bowed as the Emperor passed
them. When he had got to the end of the line, M. de
Combelot presented to him one of the two academicians, who
had come to Court for the first time. The Emperor spoke of
a recent work which this writer had issued, and declared that
certain passages of it had afforded him the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p>By this time the Empress Eugénie had also entered the
room, attended by Madame de Llorentz. She was dressed
very simply in a blue silk gown with a tunic of white lace,
and she advanced with slow steps, smiling towards the
ladies and graciously inclining her bare neck, from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
a diamond heart was suspended by a ribbon of blue velvet.
The ladies curtsied to her with much rustling and spreading
of their skirts, from which rose strong perfumes. Madame de
Llorentz presented a young woman, who seemed deeply
moved; whereas Madame de Combelot put on an air of
affectionate familiarity.</p>

<p>When the sovereigns had reached the end of the double
line, they retraced their steps; the Emperor now turning
towards the ladies, and the Empress towards the men. There
were some more presentations. No one spoke; respectful
embarrassment kept all the guests face to face in silence.
However, when the adjutant-general of the palace entered to
announce that dinner was served, the lines broke up, remarks
were exchanged <i>sotto voce</i>, and there came little bursts of
cheery laughter.</p>

<p>'Ah! you don't want me any longer now!' said M. de
Plouguern in Clorinde's ear.</p>

<p>She smiled at him. She had kept in front of M. de Marsy
in order to compel him to offer her his arm, which he did
with a gallant air. There was some little confusion. The
Emperor and Empress went out first, followed by the guests
who were to sit on their right and left. That day two foreign
diplomatists, a young American lady, and a minister's wife
had been selected for this honour. After these came the
other guests in such order as they chose, each gentleman
giving his arm to the lady he had been pleased to select.
And thus the procession got slowly under way.</p>

<p>The entry into the dining-hall was very pompous. Five
cut-glass chandeliers sparkled above the long table, illumining
the silver centre-pieces, which represented such hunting scenes
as the starting of the stag, the horns sounding the view-halloa,
and the hounds seizing the quarry. Silver plates were
disposed round the edge of the cloth like a border of glittering
moons; and the silver warmers reflecting the blaze of the
candles, the glass with its quivering coruscations, the fruit
stands, and the bright pink flower vases, gave quite a splendour
to the Imperial table, a sheeny brilliance which filled the
whole huge room.</p>

<p>The procession slowly crossed the Hall of the Guards
before entering the dining-room, whose folding doors stood
wide open. The men bent down and said a word or two, and
then drew erect again, feeling secretly vain of this triumphal
march, while the ladies beamed radiantly, their bare shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
steeped in the brilliant light. Their long trains, sweeping the
carpets at regular intervals between each successive couple,
lent additional majesty to the procession, the rustling of all
the rich tissues sounding like a soft accompaniment. As the
threshold of the dining-room was reached, and the superb
array of the table came into sight, a military band, hidden
from view in an adjoining gallery, greeted the company with
a flourish, like a signal for some fairy gala, and, at the sound
of it, the gentlemen, who felt somewhat ill at ease in their
short breeches, involuntarily pressed their partners' arms.</p>

<p>However, the Empress passed down the room on the
right, and remained standing by the centre of the table, while
the Emperor, going to the left, took up position opposite to
her. Then, when the selected guests had taken their places
at the right and left of their Majesties, the others glanced
round for a moment, and chose what places they liked. On
that particular evening covers were laid for eighty-seven.
Some three minutes elapsed before everyone had entered
the room and chosen seats. The satiny sheen of the
ladies' shoulders, the bright flowers in their dresses, and the
diamonds sparkling in their piled-up hair, lent as it were
living mirth to the full light of the crystal chandeliers. At
last the footmen took the Court hats, which the gentlemen
had hitherto carried in their hands; and then everyone sat
down.</p>

<p>M. de Plouguern had followed Rougon. After the soup
had been served, he nudged him and inquired—'Have you
commissioned Clorinde to bring about a reconciliation between
you and Marsy?'</p>

<p>Then, with a glance, he pointed out the young woman, who
sat on the other side of the table beside the Count, to whom
she was talking with an air of tender interest. Rougon
seemed much annoyed, but he merely shrugged his shoulders,
and pretended to look in another direction. In spite, however,
of his attempt at indifference, his eyes strayed back
to Clorinde, and he began to observe her slightest gestures,
and even the movements of her lips, as though he were
anxious to discover what she was saying.</p>

<p>Just then, however, he was spoken to.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Rougon,' said Madame de Combelot, who had
got as near to the Emperor as she could, 'do you recollect that
accident when you got a cab for me? One of the flounces of
my dress was completely torn away.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>She was trying to make herself interesting by relating how
her carriage had been nearly cut in halves by the landau of a
Russian prince. Then Rougon was obliged to reply; and for
a short time the incident became the subject of conversation
among those placed near the middle of the table. All kinds
of accidents were quoted, and, among others, one which had
happened to a woman, a well-known dealer in perfumery, who
had fallen from her horse during the previous week, and had
broken her arm. The Empress on hearing this raised a slight
exclamation of pity. The Emperor said nothing but listened
with a profound expression, while eating very slowly.</p>

<p>'Where's Delestang got to?' Rougon now asked of M. de
Plouguern.</p>

<p>They looked about, and the senator at last caught sight of
him at the end of the table. Seated next to M. de Combelot,
among a row of men, he was listening to the broad conversation
which was there being carried on under cover of the
general talk. M. La Rouquette had been relating a somewhat
free story about a laundress of his native place, and now
Chevalier Rusconi was favouring the others with some personal
criticisms of the women of Paris; while one of the two
artists and the novelist, a little lower down the table, bluntly
passed judgment on the ladies whose lean or over-fleshy arms
excited their mockery. And Rougon angrily transferred his
gaze from Clorinde, who was growing more and more amiable
in her manner towards the Count, to her imbecile of a
husband, who sat smiling, in a dignified way, at the rather
strong anecdotes with which his ears were being regaled.</p>

<p>'Why didn't he come and sit with us?' muttered the
great man.</p>

<p>'Oh! I don't pity him. They seem to be amusing themselves
down there,' said M. de Plouguern. And he continued
in a whisper: 'I fancy they are making merry at Madame de
Llorentz's expense. Have you noticed how indecently she's
dressed? Just look at her bodice, how low it is.'</p>

<p>However, as he turned to get a better view of Madame de
Llorentz, who was on the same side of the table as himself,
some five seats away, his face suddenly became very grave.
The lady's countenance—she was a beautiful, plump blonde—had
assumed a furious expression; she was white with
suppressed rage, and her blue eyes seemed to be turning black
as they glowered fiercely on M. de Marsy and Clorinde.</p>

<p>'There's going to be a row,' muttered the old senator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
between his teeth, in such wise that even Rougon could not
tell what he was saying.</p>

<p>The band was still playing; the hidden, distant music
sounding as though it proceeded from the ceiling. Every
now and then, at some sudden blare of the brass instruments,
the guests raised their heads, as though seeking to identify
the strain which was being played; but the next moment
they could hear nothing distinctly for the light notes of the
clarionets mingled with the jingling of the silver plate,
which the servants carried about in piles. The big dishes
gave out a clanking sound, like so many cymbals. All
round the table there was much silent hurrying to and
fro. A whole army of servants flitted hither and thither
without speaking a word; ushers in swallow-tails and
bright blue breeches, with swords at their sides and cocked
hats under their arms; and footmen with powdered hair, in
full-dress livery of green cloth, laced with gold. The dishes
were brought in and the wines circulated in proper order,
while the heads of the different household services, the controllers,
the chief carver, and the chief custodian of the plate,
stood round, and superintended all the intricate manœuvring
which marked the seeming confusion, in which the <i>rôles</i> of
the most insignificant footmen had been carefully arranged
beforehand. And behind the Emperor and Empress were
their Majesties' own private valets, who waited upon them
with an air of decorous dignity.</p>

<p>When the roasts arrived and the great wines of Burgundy
were poured into the guests' glasses, the chatter of voices
grew louder. Among the men at the end of the table,
M. La Rouquette was now discoursing upon culinary matters,
notably with regard to the amount of cooking which the
haunch of venison then being served had received. The
previous dishes had comprised Crecy soup, salmon <i>au bleu</i>,
fillet of beef with shallot sauce, pullets <i>à la financière</i>, partridges
with cabbage, and oyster patties.</p>

<p>'I'll bet that we shall have stewed cardoons and vegetable-marrow
with melted butter,' said the young deputy.</p>

<p>'I have seen some crayfish,' remarked Delestang politely.</p>

<p>However, as the cardoons and vegetable-marrow were
just then served, M. La Rouquette was loud in his expressions
of triumph. He knew the Empress's tastes, he declared.
But the novelist glanced at the artist, and said, with a cluck
of the tongue: 'The cooking's rather poor.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>The artist pouted his assent. Then, when he had taken a
sip from his glass, he said: 'The wines are exquisite.'</p>

<p>Just at that moment, however, a sudden laugh from the
Empress rang so loudly through the room that everyone
became silent, and craned forward to discover what had given
rise to it. The Empress was talking to the Prussian Ambassador,
who sat on her right. She was still laughing and
uttering broken words which the guests could not catch.
But amidst the silence caused by the general curiosity, a
cornet-à-piston, softly accompanied by some bassoons, began
to play a pretty, sentimental air. Then the general murmur
of conversation arose once more. Chairs were turned half-round
and elbows rested on the table as sections of the guests
began to chat together, as if they were at some luxurious <i>table-d'hôte</i>.</p>

<p>'Will you have a rout cake?' asked M. de Plouguern.</p>

<p>Rougon shook his head in refusal. For a moment he had
been eating nothing. The servants had replaced the silver
plate by Sèvres porcelain, beautifully decorated in blue and
pink. Then the whole dessert went in procession past Rougon,
but he would only accept a small piece of Camembert. He
had ceased to exercise any restraint over himself, and gazed
openly at M. de Marsy and Clorinde, in the hope, probably, of
being able to intimidate the young woman. But she affected
such familiarity with Marsy that she seemed to have forgotten
where she was, and to fancy herself in some private room
where a light supper had been served for two. Her beautiful
face sparkled with tenderness; and as she munched the
sweetmeats which the Count handed to her, she tranquilly
prosecuted her conquest with never-failing smile and superb
assurance. The people near them had begun to whisper.</p>

<p>However, the general conversation turned upon the subject
of fashion, and M. de Plouguern mischievously asked Clorinde
about the new shape of bonnets. Then, as she pretended not
to hear him, he turned round in order to address the same
question to Madame de Llorentz. But when he saw her
angry, threatening face, with its clenched teeth and tragic
expression of furious jealousy, he did not dare to carry out his
intention. Clorinde, as it happened, had just surrendered her
hand to M. de Marsy on the pretext of letting him look at an
antique cameo which she wore on a finger-ring. And she let
the Count hold her hand while he took off the ring and then
put it back again. This seemed to be going too far. Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
de Llorentz, who was nervously playing with a spoon, upset a
wine-glass and broke it. One of the servants immediately
removed the fragments.</p>

<p>'They will be tearing each other's hair by-and-bye,' the
senator whispered to Rougon. 'Have you watched them?
But, the deuce take me if I can understand Clorinde's game!
What's she up to, eh?'</p>

<p>Then, as he raised his eyes to his neighbour, he was quite
taken aback by the strange change which he noticed in
Rougon's face. 'What's the matter with you? Aren't you
well?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' Rougon replied, 'but it's so close here; these
dinners last so long. And then there's such a strong scent of
musk.'</p>

<p>The dinner, however, was now at an end, though a few
ladies were still nibbling biscuits as they leant back in their
chairs. No one moved; but the Emperor, who had hitherto
preserved silence, suddenly raised his voice, and the guests at
either end of the table, who had completely forgotten his
Majesty's presence, suddenly strained their ears to catch his
remarks. He was replying to a dissertation from M. Beulin-d'Orchère
against the practice of divorcing married people,
which at that time did not prevail in France. And after
pausing and glancing at the very low bodice of the young
American lady who sat on his right hand, his Majesty said in
a drawling voice: 'In America I never knew of any but plain
wives being divorced.'</p>

<p>At this a laugh ran through the guests. The remark
seemed one of such fine and delicate wit that M. La Rouquette
pondered over it in the hope of being able to discover some
hidden meaning. The young American lady, however, appeared
to think it a compliment, for she bowed to the
Emperor in pleased confusion. Their Majesties now rose
from their seats. There was a loud rustling and tramping
round the table; and the ushers and footmen, standing
gravely in line against the wall, alone preserved an attitude
of decorum amidst the scramble of all these people who had
dined so well. However, the procession was formed anew;
their Majesties at the head, followed by the guests in double
file, with the various couples parted by the ladies' spreading
trains. They passed through the Guard Room with somewhat
panting dignity, while behind them, in the full light of
the crystal chandeliers, over the litter of the disordered table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
there resounded the big drum of the military band, which
was finishing the last figure of a quadrille.</p>

<p>Coffee was served that evening in the Gallery of the
Maps. One of the prefects of the palace presented the
Emperor's cup on a silver-gilt salver. Several of the guests,
however, had already gone off to the smoking-room, while the
Empress had retired with a few ladies to her private drawing-room
on the left of the gallery. It was whispered that she
had expressed much displeasure at the peculiar manner in
which Clorinde had behaved during dinner. During the
yearly visits to Compiègne she tried to introduce something
like homely decorum into the habits of the Court, with a taste
for innocent amusements and rural pleasure; and she displayed
a strong personal antipathy to certain eccentricities.</p>

<p>M. de Plouguern had taken Clorinde aside to preach her a
little sermon, in the hope of worming a confession out of her.
But the young woman affected great surprise. How had she
compromised herself with Count de Marsy? They had only
joked together, nothing more.</p>

<p>'Well, look there, then,' said the old senator. And forthwith
he pushed back a door which already stood ajar, and
showed her Madame de Llorentz storming away at M. de
Marsy in a little adjacent <i>salon</i>, which he had previously
seen them enter. Wild with rage, the beautiful blonde was
assailing Marsy in the most unmeasured language, quite regardless
of the fact that the loud voice in which she was
speaking might bring about a terrible scandal. The Count,
although a little pale, was smiling and trying to appease her,
talking to her rapidly in low soft tones. Sounds of the
quarrel had, however, reached the gallery, and the guests who
heard them prudently retired from the neighbourhood of the
little room.</p>

<p>'Do you want her to publish those famous letters all over
the château?' asked M. de Plouguern, who had begun to pace
up and down again, after giving his arm to Clorinde.</p>

<p>'It would be fine fun!' she exclaimed with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>Then the old senator, squeezing her arm like some young
gallant, began to scold her again. She must leave all eccentric
behaviour to Madame de Combelot, he told her. And he
went on to say that her Majesty appeared very much annoyed
with her. At this Clorinde, who cherished a sincere devotion
for the Empress, seemed quite astonished. What had she
done that could have displeased her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, as they reached the entrance of her Majesty's
private drawing-room, they stopped for a moment and peeped
through the doorway, which had been left open. A circle of
ladies had gathered round a large table, and the Empress was
patiently teaching them ring puzzles, while a few gentlemen
stood behind the chairs and gravely followed the lesson.</p>

<p>In the meantime Rougon had been disputing with Delestang
at the end of the gallery. He had not ventured to
speak to him about his wife, but was reproaching him for the
indifference with which he had allowed himself to be stowed
away in a room which overlooked the courtyard of the
château, and he tried to induce him to claim one with a view
over the park. However, Clorinde came towards them leaning
on M. de Plouguern's arm.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't bother me any more about your Marsy!' she
said loudly enough to be heard. 'I won't speak to him again
this evening. There! will that satisfy you?'</p>

<p>This remark quieted everybody. Just at that moment
M. de Marsy came out of the little room looking quite gay.
He stopped to joke for a moment with Chevalier Rusconi, and
then entered the private drawing-room, where soon afterwards
the Empress and the ladies could be heard laughing at some
story he was telling them. Ten minutes later, Madame de
Llorentz also reappeared. She looked weary and her hands
were trembling. Observing, however, the curious glances
which took note of her slightest gestures, she boldly remained
in the gallery conversing with the various guests.</p>

<p>There was a growing feeling of weariness among the
company, who began to yawn slightly behind their handkerchiefs.
The evening was the most trying time. The newly-invited
guests, not knowing how to amuse themselves, went
up to the windows and gazed into the darkness. M. Beulin-d'Orchère
continued his dissertation against divorce laws in a
corner of the room; while the novelist, who felt greatly
bored, asked one of the academicians in a whisper if it was
permissible to go to bed. Every now and then, however, the
Emperor made his appearance and lounged through the gallery
with a cigarette between his lips.</p>

<p>'It was impossible to arrange anything for this evening,'
M. de Combelot explained to the little group in which
Rougon and his friends were gathered. 'To-morrow, after
the stag-hunt, the offal will be given to the hounds by torchlight.
Then on the day after to-morrow the artistes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Comédie Française are coming to play <i>Les Plaideurs</i>. There
is a talk, too, of some <i>tableaux vivants</i> and a charade, which
will be performed towards the end of the week.'</p>

<p>Then he gave them details. His wife was going to take a
part, and the rehearsals would soon begin. He also spoke at
length about an excursion which the Court had made two days
previously to a druidical monolith, in the neighbourhood of
which some excavations were being carried on. The Empress
had insisted upon getting down into the pit which had been
dug.</p>

<p>'And do you know,' continued the chamberlain, in tones
of emotion, 'the workmen were lucky enough to turn up two
skulls in her Majesty's presence. No one was expecting such
a thing, and it caused great satisfaction.'</p>

<p>So saying, he stroked that black beard of his which had
been the source of so much of his success among the ladies.
There was a somewhat sawny look about his handsome face,
of which he was evidently vain, and he lisped as he spoke.</p>

<p>'But I was told,' said Clorinde, 'that the actors of the
Vaudeville were coming down to perform their new piece.
The women wear the most wonderful dresses, and it's excruciatingly
funny, I hear.'</p>

<p>M. de Combelot assumed a prudish expression. 'Yes,' he
said, 'it was talked of for a moment.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'The idea has been abandoned. The Empress doesn't
like that kind of piece.'</p>

<p>At this moment there was a general stir in the gallery.
All the men had come down from the smoking-room again,
and the Emperor was going to play his game at table quoits.
Madame de Combelot, who prided herself upon being a very
skilful player, had just asked him to give her her revenge, for
she recollected having been beaten by him during the previous
season. As she spoke to him she assumed an air of such
humble tenderness and such a meaning smile, that his
Majesty, ill at ease and rather alarmed, was obliged to turn
his eyes away from her.</p>

<p>The game began. A large number of guests gathered
round and admiringly criticised the play. Standing at the
end of the long table, which was covered with a green cloth,
the young woman threw her first quoit, which alighted near
the white point representing the pin. Then the Emperor,
showing even greater skill, dislodged it with his own quoit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
which slipped into its place. The spectators softly applauded.
However, it was Madame de Combelot who won in the end.</p>

<p>'What have we been playing for, sire?' she boldly
inquired.</p>

<p>The Emperor smiled, but made no reply. Then he turned
round and said: 'Monsieur Rougon, will you have a game
with me?'</p>

<p>Rougon bowed and took up the quoits, while apologising
for his unskilfulness at the game.</p>

<p>A thrill of excitement ran through the spectators, who
stood on either side of the table. Was Rougon really coming
into favour again? The latent hostility which had encompassed
him ever since his arrival now melted, and the guests bent
forward and watched his quoits with an air of sympathy. M.
La Rouquette, feeling still more perplexed than he had been
before dinner, drew his sister aside to ask her what was the
true state of affairs, but she was apparently unable to give
him any satisfactory information, for he returned to the table
making a gesture of perplexity.</p>

<p>'Ah, very good!' murmured Clorinde, as Rougon made a
skilful cast.</p>

<p>She darted meaning glances at those friends of the great
man who were present. The opportunity seemed a favourable
one for helping him back into the Emperor's good
graces. She commenced the onset herself, and for a moment
or two there was a burst of laudatory remarks.</p>

<p>'The deuce!' exclaimed Delestang, who could think of
nothing else to say, though he was anxious to obey the mute
command of his wife's eyes.</p>

<p>'And you pretended that you were a very poor player,'
said Chevalier Rusconi delightedly. 'Ah, sire, pray don't
play for France with him.'</p>

<p>'But Monsieur Rougon would treat France very well, I'm
sure,' interposed M. Beulin-d'Orchère, with a meaning expression
on his dog-like face.</p>

<p>It was a direct hint. The Emperor deigned to smile;
and he even laughed good-naturedly when Rougon, quite
embarrassed by the compliments, modestly explained: 'Well,
I used to play at pitch and toss when I was a boy.'</p>

<p>On hearing his Majesty laugh, all the company did
likewise; and for a moment the gallery rang with merriment.
Clorinde, with her sharp wits, had realised that by admiring
Rougon, who was in fact a very poor player, one really flattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the Emperor, who was incontestably his superior.
M. de Plouguern, however, had not yet come forward, feeling
a touch of jealousy at Rougon's success. So Clorinde went
up to him and nudged his elbow as if by accident. He
understood, her meaning, and warmly praised his colleague's
next throw. Then M. La Rouquette made up his mind to
risk everything, and exclaimed: 'Yes, that was beautiful, a
delightfully soft throw!'</p>

<p>As the Emperor won the game, Rougon asked for his
revenge, and the quoits were again gliding over the green
cloth with a faint rustling sound like that of dry leaves,
when a lady-attendant appeared at the door of the drawing-room,
holding the Prince Imperial in her arms. The child
who was then some twenty months old, was dressed in a
plain white robe. His hair was in disorder and his eyes were
heavy with sleep. When he awoke of an evening in this way
he was generally brought to the Empress for a moment so
that she might kiss him. He looked at the light with the
serious expression characteristic of little children.</p>

<p>However, an old man, a great dignitary of the Empire,
came forward, dragging his gouty legs. And bending down,
with a senile tremor of his head, he took hold of the baby-prince's
soft little hand and kissed it, saying in quavering
accents as he did so: 'Monseigneur, monseigneur——'</p>

<p>But the child, alarmed by the other's parchment-like
visage, hastily recoiled, clinging to the lady who carried him,
and venting cries of fear. Still the old man did not let go
his hold; he continued to protest his devotion, and it was
necessary to release the little hand, which he held tightly to
his lips, from his adoring grasp.</p>

<p>'Go away, take him off!' cried the Emperor impatiently,
to the lady-attendant.</p>

<p>His Majesty had just lost the second game, and the deciding
one began. Rougon, taking the praises which he
received in serious earnest, exerted all his skill. Clorinde
was now of opinion that he played too well, and, just as he
was going to pick up his quoits, she whispered in his ear:
'I hope you do not mean to win.'</p>

<p>Rougon smiled. But all at once a loud bark was heard.
It came from Nero, the Emperor's favourite pointer, which,
taking advantage of an open door, had just bounded into the
gallery. His Majesty ordered the dog to be taken away, and
a servant had already caught hold of its collar when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
aged dignitary again sprang forward and exclaimed: 'My
beautiful Nero! my beautiful Nero!'</p>

<p>He almost knelt upon the carpet in order to take the dog
in his tremulous arms. He pressed its head to his breast
and kissed it as he said: 'I beg of you, sire, do not send him
away. How handsome he is!'</p>

<p>The Emperor consented that the dog should remain, and
the old man went on with his caresses. Unlike the little
prince, Nero showed no sign of fear, but licked the withered
hands that fondled him.</p>

<p>Rougon, meantime, was blundering in his play. He had
just thrown a quoit so clumsily that the leaden disc, faced with
cloth, flew into the corsage of a lady who, with a deal of
blushing, drew it from amidst her lace. The Emperor won
the game, and the company delicately gave him to understand
that he had gained a real victory. His Majesty seemed quite
affected by it, and went off with Rougon, chatting to him as
though he wanted to console him for his defeat. They
strolled to the end of the gallery, leaving the body of the room
free for a little dance which was just then being arranged.</p>

<p>The Empress, who had left the private drawing-room, was
trying to relieve the increasing boredom of her guests. She
had proposed a game of 'Consequences,' but it was getting
late, and the company seemed to prefer a dance. All the
ladies were now assembled in the Gallery of the Maps, and a
messenger was sent to the smoking-room to summon such
gentlemen as were still hiding there. As the dancers took up
their positions for a quadrille, M. de Combelot obligingly
seated himself at the piano-organ, the handle of which he
gravely began to turn.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>'Monsieur Rougon,' said the Emperor, 'I have heard some
talk of a work you are engaged upon; a comparison of the
English constitution with our own. I might be able to supply
you with some useful documents.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>'Your Majesty is very kind. But I am contemplating
another design; a very great one indeed.'</p>

<p>Rougon, finding his sovereign so kindly disposed, was
desirous of profiting by it, and he thereupon unfolded his plan,
his dream of reclaiming and cultivating the Landes, of clearing
several square leagues of soil, founding a town, and conquering,
as it were, a new country. As he spoke, the Emperor
looked at him, and in his eyes, usually so expressionless, there
now shone a glistening light. For a time, however, he said
nothing, merely nodding every now and then. But when
Rougon at last finished, he rejoined: 'Yes, perhaps—it is to
be thought over.' Then, turning towards Clorinde, her
husband, and M. de Plouguern, who stood in a group near at
hand, he said: 'Monsieur Delestang, come and give us your
opinion. I have retained the most pleasant recollection of
my visit to your model farm of La Chamade.'</p>

<p>Delestang stepped forward; however, the little group which
was clustering round the Emperor now had to retreat into one
of the window-recesses. A waltz was being danced, and as
Madame de Combelot passed by, reclining in M. La Rouquette's
arms, she had just swept her long train round his Majesty's
silk stockings. At the piano M. de Combelot seemed to be
quite enjoying the music he was calling forth, for he turned
the handle more rapidly than ever, swaying his handsome
head, and every now and then glancing towards the body of
the instrument, as though surprised at the deep notes which
came from it at certain turns he gave.</p>

<p>'I have bred some magnificent calves this year, by a fresh
crossing of strains,' said Delestang. 'Unfortunately, when
your Majesty visited me, the stalls and folds were under
repair.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the Emperor began to speak slowly and spasmodically
of agriculture, cattle-breeding, and manures. He
had entertained great esteem for Delestang ever since his
visit to La Chamade; and was particularly pleased with the
system which the latter had introduced whereby his farm-hands
lived in common, shared certain profits, and became
entitled to old-age pensions. Napoleon and Clorinde's husband
had ideas in common, certain humanitarian principles which
enabled them to grasp each other's thoughts at a word.</p>

<p>'Has Monsieur Rougon spoken to you about his plan?'
the Emperor asked.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes!' answered Delestang. 'It is a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
scheme, and affords a chance of experimenting on a very grand
scale.'</p>

<p>He evinced genuine enthusiasm. He was greatly interested
in pig-breeding, he said. The best breeds were dying
out in France. Then he remarked that he was perfecting a
new plan for the improvement of meadow-lands; but to make
it fully successful, large tracts of country would be necessary.
However, if Rougon should succeed, he would join him and
put his system to trial. Then, all at once he stopped
short, for he had just noticed that his wife's eyes were earnestly
fixed upon him. Ever since he had begun to express his
approval of Rougon's scheme, she had been biting her lips,
looking pale and wrathful. 'Come, my dear,' she said to
him, motioning towards the piano-organ.</p>

<p>M. de Combelot's fingers had now grown cramped, and he
was opening and shutting his hands to remove the stiffness.
Nevertheless, with the smile of a martyr he got ready to begin
a polka when Delestang hastened forward and offered to take
his place; an offer which he accepted politely, as though giving
up a post of honour. Then Delestang turned the handle, and
the polka began. But somehow the music now sounded
differently; he lacked the chamberlain's flexible, supple
wrist.</p>

<p>Rougon, however, was anxious to get some definite expression
of opinion from the Emperor. His Majesty, who really
seemed impressed, asked him if he contemplated establishing
some large industrial colonies over yonder, and added that he
should be glad to grant a strip of land, water supply, and tools
to each family. Moreover, he promised to show Rougon
some plans of his own, which he had noted down on paper,
for the establishment of a place of the kind, where the houses
would be of uniform construction, and every want would be
provided for.</p>

<p>'Certainly, I quite enter into your Majesty's ideas,' said
Rougon, though, truth to tell, Napoleon's vague socialism made
him impatient. 'We can do nothing without your Majesty's
assistance and authority. It will doubtless be necessary to
expropriate certain villages, and it will have to be stated that
this is done for the public good. I shall also have to launch
a company to provide the requisite funds. A word from your
Majesty will be necessary——'</p>

<p>The Emperor's eyes grew dim; but he went on nodding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Finally, in an indistinct voice, he said: 'We will see—we will
talk about it.'</p>

<p>Then he walked away, passing with heavy steps through
the quadrille party. Rougon put on a cheerful countenance,
as though he felt sure of obtaining a favourable answer.
Clorinde, however, was radiant. By degrees a report spread
among the grave, staid men who did not dance that Rougon
was going to leave Paris, and place himself at the head of a
great undertaking in the south of France. Then they all came
to congratulate him, and he was smiled upon from one end of
the gallery to the other. Not a trace remained of the hostility
which had been shown him when he first arrived. Now that
he was voluntarily going into exile, they all felt that they
could shake hands with him without risk of compromising
themselves. This was genuine relief for many of the guests.
M. La Rouquette, quitting the dancing party, discussed the
matter with Chevalier Rusconi, with the delight of a man
completely set at his ease. 'It's the right thing he's doing!
He will make a great success down there!' said the young
deputy. 'Rougon is an extremely able man, but in politics
he is deficient in tact.'</p>

<p>Then he waxed quite emotional over the Emperor's
kindness. His Majesty, he said, showed as much regard for
his old servants as if they were old mistresses. He felt
affection for them even after the most violent ruptures. It
was some secret softening of the heart, no doubt, that had
prompted him to invite Rougon to Compiègne. And La
Rouquette cited other incidents which did honour to his
Majesty's kindness of nature. He had given four hundred
thousand francs to pay the debts of a general who had been
ruined by a ballet girl; he had bestowed eight hundred
thousand upon one of his old accomplices at Strasburg and
Boulogne as a wedding present, and had laid out nearly a
million for the benefit of the widow of a high functionary.</p>

<p>'His purse is at every one's disposal,' he said in conclusion.
'He only allowed himself to be chosen Emperor in order that
he might be able to benefit his friends. It makes me shrug
my shoulders when I hear Republicans reproaching him for
his big civil list.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He would exhaust ten civil lists in doing
good. All the money he gets comes back to France again.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>While chatting in an undertone after this fashion, La
Rouquette and Chevalier Rusconi continued to watch the
Emperor. He was just completing his round of the gallery.
He adroitly threaded his way through the dancers, silently
crossing the clear spaces which their respect opened out for
him. Whenever he passed behind a lady who was sitting
down, he slightly inclined his neck and cast an oblique glance
at her bare shoulders.</p>

<p>'And he has such a mind, too!' said Chevalier Rusconi
in a whisper. 'He is an extraordinary man!'</p>

<p>The Emperor was now quite close to them. For a moment
he lingered where he stood, hesitating and gloomy. Then he
seemed inclined to approach Clorinde, who was looking very
merry and beautiful, but she suddenly fixed her eyes on him so
boldly that he seemed frightened, for he went on again, holding
his left arm behind his back, and twisting the ends of his waxed
moustache with his right hand. At last, seeing M. Beulin-d'Orchère
in front of him, he approached him sideways and
said: 'You are not dancing.'</p>

<p>The judge confessed that he could not dance, that he
had never danced in his life. Then the Emperor replied
encouragingly: 'Oh, that doesn't matter! That needn't
keep you from dancing now.'</p>

<p>Those were his last words for the evening. He quietly
made his way to the door, and disappeared.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, he is an extraordinary man,' said M. La
Rouquette, repeating Chevalier Rusconi's phrase. 'They
think a great deal of him abroad, don't they?'</p>

<p>The Chevalier, with diplomatic reserve, nodded vaguely.
He admitted, however, that the eyes of Europe were fixed
upon the Emperor. A word spoken at the Tuileries made
neighbouring thrones tremble.</p>

<p>'He is a prince who knows how to hold his tongue,'
he added with a smile, the subtle irony of which escaped the
young deputy.</p>

<p>Then they returned to the ladies and invited partners for
the next quadrille. For the last quarter of an hour an aide-de-camp
had been turning the handle of the piano-organ.
Both Delestang and M. de Combelot now sprang forward and
offered to take his place. The ladies, however, cried out:
'Monsieur de Combelot! Monsieur de Combelot! He does it
much the best!'</p>

<p>The chamberlain thanked them for the compliment with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
bow, and began to turn the handle with professional vigour.
It was the last quadrille. Tea had just been served in the
private drawing-room. Nero, having made his appearance
from behind a couch, was glutted with sandwiches. The
guests gathered in little groups and chatted familiarly. M. de
Plouguern, who had carried a little cake to a side table, ate it
and sipped his tea, while explaining to Delestang how it was
that he, so well known to hold Legitimist opinions, had come
to accept invitations to Compiègne. The reason was very
simple, he said. He could not refuse his support to a government
which rescued France from anarchy. Then he broke
off to say: 'This cake is very nice. I didn't make a very
good dinner this evening.'</p>

<p>His caustic tongue was always ready to wag when he
found himself at Compiègne. He spoke of most of the ladies
present with a bluntness which called blushes to Delestang's
face. The only one for whom he showed respect was the
Empress. She was a saint, he said, a woman of exemplary
devotion. He asserted, too, that she was a Legitimist, and
would have recalled Henry V. to the throne had she been free
to do so. Then, for a moment, he dwelt upon the delights of
religion. Just as he was sliding off into an indelicate story,
the Empress retired to her own rooms, followed by Madame
de Llorentz. On reaching the threshold of the salon, she
made a low courtesy to the company, who bowed to her in
silence.</p>

<p>The rooms now began to get empty. The remaining
guests talked in louder tones, and exchanged parting shakes of
the hand. When Delestang looked for his wife to go upstairs
with her he could not find her. At last, Rougon, who helped
him in his search, discovered Clorinde sitting with M. de
Marsy in the little room where Madame de Llorentz had so
violently upbraided the Count after dinner. The young
woman was laughing loudly. When she saw her husband
she rose up. 'Good-evening, Monsieur le Comte,' she gaily
said to Marsy; 'you will see to-morrow, at the hunt, if I
don't win my bet.'</p>

<p>Rougon glanced after her as her husband led her away on
his arm. He would have liked to accompany them to their
door to ascertain what bet it was that she had spoken of, but
M. de Marsy, evincing the greatest politeness, detained him,
and he could not get away. When he was at last free,
instead of going up to his room, he took advantage of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
open door to slip into the park. It was a very dark October
night, without a star or a puff of wind, a black, dead night.
Lofty plantations arose far away like promontories of darkness.
He could scarcely distinguish the paths in front of him.
Holding his hat in his hand, he let the cool night air play on
his brow for a moment. This freshened him like a bath.
Then he lingered there looking at a brightly-lighted window
on the left front of the château. The other windows gradually
became black, and this was soon the only gleaming spot
in the sleeping pile. The Emperor was sitting up. And
Rougon fancied he could distinguish his shadow passing
across the blind, a huge head beyond which projected the
ends of a long moustache. It was followed by two other
shadows; one very slight, and the other so big that it shut
off all the light. In the latter Rougon clearly recognised the
gigantic silhouette of an agent of the secret police, with
whom his Majesty frequently closeted himself for hours.
Then, as the slimmer shadow again passed before the window,
Rougon thought it seemed like a woman's. However,
nothing more appeared, the window glowed in all quietude,
like some large bright eye gazing into the mysterious depths
of the park. Perhaps, thought Rougon, the Emperor was
now considering his scheme for clearing the Landes and
founding an industrial centre, where the extinction of
pauperism might be attempted on a large scale. He knew
that Napoleon frequently came to important determinations
at night-time. It was at night that he signed decrees, wrote
manifestoes and dismissed his ministers. But presently
Rougon began to smile. He had recalled a story of the
Emperor wearing a blue apron, and hanging wall-paper at
three francs a piece in a room at Trianon, where he intended
to lodge a mistress; and he pictured him now, in the silence
of his study, cutting out woodcuts and sticking them neatly
in a scrap-book.</p>

<p>But all at once Rougon found himself raising his arms
and involuntarily exclaiming aloud: 'Ah! <i>his</i> friends made
him!'</p>

<p>Then he hurried back into the château. He was beginning
to feel very cold, especially about the legs, which his knee-breeches
left uncomfortably exposed.</p>

<p>A little before nine o'clock on the following morning
Clorinde sent Antonia, whom she had brought with her, to
ask Rougon if she and her husband might breakfast with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
him. He had already ordered a cup of chocolate, but did not
touch it till they came. Antonia preceded them, carrying a
large silver salver on which their coffee had been brought to
their bedroom.</p>

<p>'Ah! this will be more cheerful!' exclaimed Clorinde as
she entered. 'You have got the sun on your side. You are
much better off than we are.'</p>

<p>Then she began to inspect the suite of rooms. It consisted
of an ante-chamber, on the right of which there was
a little room for a valet. Then there was the guest's bedroom,
a spacious apartment hung with cream-coloured chintz
having a pattern of big red flowers. There was a large
square mahogany bedstead and an immense grate in which
some huge logs were blazing.</p>

<p>'Of course! You ought to have complained!' said
Rougon. 'I would not have put up with a room looking
on to the courtyard. Ah! if people don't assert themselves—I
was talking to Delestang about it only last night.'</p>

<p>The young woman shrugged her shoulders and replied:
'Oh! he would raise no objection if they wanted to lodge me
in a garret!'</p>

<p>However, she now wished to examine the dressing-room,
all the fittings of which were of Sèvres porcelain, white and
gold, with the Imperial monogram. Then she went to look
out of the window, and a faint cry of surprise and admiration
came from her lips. For leagues in front of her, the lofty
trees of the forest of Compiègne spread out like a rolling sea,
their huge crests rising and falling in gentle billows, till they
faded from sight in the distance. And in the pale sunlight
of that October morning, the forest glowed alternately with
gold and purple, with the splendour of a gorgeously embroidered
mantle spread out from horizon to horizon.</p>

<p>'Come, let us have breakfast!' said Clorinde.</p>

<p>They cleared a table on which were an inkstand and a
blotting-pad, finding it rather amusing to wait upon themselves.
The young woman, who was in a very merry mood,
declared that on awaking that morning it had seemed to her
as if she were in an inn, an inn kept by a prince, at which
she had alighted after a long journey through dreamland.
This haphazard kind of breakfast, served upon silver salvers,
delighted her like some adventure in an unknown country.</p>

<p>Meantime, Delestang gazed in wonder at the quantity of
wood which was burning in the grate. And at last, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
eyes still fixed upon the flames, he muttered thoughtfully:
'I have been told that they burn fifteen hundred francs'
worth of wood every day at the château. Fifteen hundred
francs' worth! Don't you think it's rather a high figure,
Rougon?'</p>

<p>Rougon, who was slowly sipping his chocolate, just nodded
his head by way of reply. He was disturbed by Clorinde's
gay animation. She seemed that morning all aglow with
feverish beauty, her eyes glistening as with the fire of battle.</p>

<p>'What was the bet you were talking about last night?'
Rougon asked abruptly.</p>

<p>She began to laugh, but as he pressed his question, she
replied: 'You will see presently.'</p>

<p>Then, by degrees, Rougon grew angry, and spoke harshly
to the young woman. It was an outburst of real jealousy,
and veiled allusions soon developed into direct accusations.
She had made a perfect exhibition of herself on the previous
evening, he said; she had let M. de Marsy hold her hand for
more than two minutes. Delestang listened to all this, but,
instead of showing any concern, quietly steeped some strips of
toast in his coffee.</p>

<p>'Ah! if I were your husband!' Rougon cried at last.</p>

<p>Clorinde had just risen, and, standing behind Delestang,
with her hands resting on his shoulders, she responded:
'Well, supposing you were my husband, what then?'</p>

<p>And stooping down, she stirred Delestang's hair with her
warm breath, as she added: 'He would behave properly,
wouldn't he, dear, just as you do?'</p>

<p>Delestang turned his head, and, by way of answer, kissed
the hand that lay on his left shoulder. He looked at Rougon
with an expression of emotion and embarrassment, blinking
as though he wished him to understand that he was really
going a little too far. Rougon nearly called him a fool.
However, when Clorinde made a sign to him over her
husband's head, he followed her to the open window, on the
handrail of which she leant. For a moment she remained
silent, her eyes fixed on the far-spreading prospect. Then
she abruptly asked him: 'Why do you want to leave Paris?
Don't you care for me any longer? Listen now; I will be
quite steady, and follow your advice, if you will give up that
plan of exiling yourself to that horrid, outlandish place.'</p>

<p>Rougon became very grave at this proposal. He began to
dwell on the great motives which influenced him; besides, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
was impossible now, he said, for him to withdraw. While he
was speaking, Clorinde vainly tried to read the real truth in
his face. He seemed quite determined to go.</p>

<p>'Very well, then; you don't care for me any longer,' resumed
the young woman. 'So I am at liberty to follow my
own inclinations. Well, you will see!'</p>

<p>Then she left the window, and once more began to laugh.
Delestang, who still seemed to find the fire a source of great
interest, was trying to calculate how many grates there might
be in the château. Clorinde, however, broke in upon his
meditations, saying that she had only just time to dress,
unless she was to miss the hunt. Rougon accompanied her
and her husband into the corridor, a long conventual passage
with a thick green carpet. And as Clorinde went off she
amused herself by reading the names of the guests, which
were written on small cards in wooden frames which hung
from the different doors. When she had got to the very end
of the corridor, she turned, and, thinking that Rougon looked
perplexed, as if he wished to call her back, she halted, and for
a moment waited smiling. But he went back into his room,
slamming the door behind him.</p>

<p>The second breakfast was served early that morning.
There was much conversation concerning the weather, which
was all that could be wished for the hunt. There was a good
clear light, and the atmosphere was calm. The Court carriages
set out shortly before noon; the meet being at the
King's Well, a large open space where several roads met in
the middle of the forest. The Imperial hunting-train had
been waiting there for more than an hour; the mounted
huntsmen in crimson breeches and great laced hats; the
dog-keepers wearing black shoes with silver buckles to enable
them to run with ease among the brushwood; while the carriages
of the guests invited from the neighbouring châteaux
were drawn up in a semicircle in front of the hounds, and in
the centre were groups of ladies and gentlemen all in Court
hunting-dress, like figures out of some old picture of the time
of Louis XV. The Emperor and the Empress did not follow
the hunt that day, and as soon as the hounds had been slipped
their Majesties' char-à-bancs turned down a bye-road and came
back to the château. Many others followed this example.
Rougon had at first tried to keep up with Clorinde, but she
spurred on her horse so wildly that he was left behind, and,
thereupon, in disgust, determined to return, infuriated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
seeing the young woman galloping in the distance down a long
avenue, with M. de Marsy by her side.</p>

<p>Towards half-past five o'clock, Rougon received an invitation
to take tea in the private apartments of the Empress.
This was a favour which was usually granted to men of
interesting and witty conversation. He found M. Beulin-d'Orchère
and M. de Plouguern already there. The latter
was relating a somewhat improper story in carefully-chosen
words, and his narrative achieved enormous success. Only a
few of the hunting-party had as yet returned. Madame de
Combelot came in, saying that she felt dreadfully tired, and
when the company asked her how matters had gone off, she
replied with an affectation of semi-technical jargon: 'Oh, the
animal beat us off for more than four hours. For a time he
unharboured in the open. But at last he turned to bay near
the Red Pool, and the death was superb.'</p>

<p>Then Chevalier Rusconi mentioned another incident with
some uneasiness. 'Madame Delestang's horse bolted,' he
said. 'She disappeared in the direction of Pierrefonds, and
nothing has since been seen or heard of her.'</p>

<p>He was at once overwhelmed with questions, and the
Empress seemed much distressed. He said that Clorinde had
kept up a tremendous pace all the time, and had excited the
admiration of the most experienced riders. All at once, however,
her horse had bolted down a side lane.</p>

<p>'She had been dreadfully whipping the poor animal,' interposed
M. La Rouquette, who was burning to get a word in.
'Monsieur de Marsy galloped off to her assistance, and he,
also, has not been seen since.'</p>

<p>At this, Madame de Llorentz, who sat behind her Majesty,
rose from her seat. She fancied that some of the company
were looking at her and smiling, and she became quite livid.
The conversation had turned upon the dangers of hunting.
One day, said one of the guests, the stag had run into a farm-yard,
and had then turned and charged the hounds so
suddenly that a lady had her leg broken amidst the confusion.
Then the company began to indulge in various suppositions.
If M. de Marsy had succeeded in checking Madame Delestang's
horse, they had, perhaps, both dismounted for a few
minutes' rest; there were a large number of shelter places,
huts and sheds and pavilions, in the forest. However, it
seemed to Madame de Llorentz that this suggestion prompted
more smiling, and that the others were stealthily eyeing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
jealous anger. As for Rougon, he kept silent, but beat a
feverish tattoo on his knees with his finger tips.</p>

<p>The Empress had given orders that Clorinde should be
asked to come and have some tea as soon as she returned.
And all at once there was a chorus of exclamations. The
young woman appeared on the threshold, with a flushed,
smiling, radiant face. She thanked her Majesty for the concern
which she showed about her, and then calmly continued:
'I am so sorry. You really shouldn't have made yourselves
uneasy. I made a bet with Monsieur de Marsy that I would
be in at the death before he was. And so I should if it hadn't
been for that provoking horse of mine.' Then she added
gaily: 'Well, we neither of us lost, after all.' However, they
made her tell them her adventure in detail, which she did,
without the least sign of confusion. After a mad gallop of
ten minutes or so, her horse had fallen, she said, but she herself
had sustained no hurt. Then, as she was trembling a
little from the excitement, M. de Marsy had taken her for a
moment into a shed.</p>

<p>'Ah, we guessed that!' exclaimed M. La Rouquette.
'You said a shed, didn't you? I myself mentioned a
pavilion.'</p>

<p>'It must have been a very uncomfortable place,' said M.
de Plouguern mischievously.</p>

<p>Clorinde, without ceasing to smile, replied slowly: 'Oh,
dear no, I assure you. There was some straw, and I sat
down. It was a big shed full of spiders' webs. It was growing
dark, too. Oh! it was very droll.' Then, looking in
Madame de Llorentz's face, and speaking with still more
deliberation, she added: 'Monsieur de Marsy was extremely
kind to me.'</p>

<p>While Clorinde had been narrating this story, Madame de
Llorentz had kept two fingers closely pressed to her lips,
and on hearing the conclusion she shut her eyes as if dazed
by anger. She remained thus for another minute; and
then, feeling that she could contain herself no further, she
left the room. M. de Plouguern, curious as to her intentions,
slipped away after her. As for Clorinde, when she saw
Madame de Llorentz disappear, an involuntary expression of
victory appeared upon her face.</p>

<p>The conversation now turned upon other subjects. M.
Beulin-d'Orchère began to speak of a scandalous lawsuit which
was exciting a deal of public interest. It was a wife's application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
for a judicial separation from her husband; and he gave
certain particulars of the affair in such delicately couched language
that Madame de Combelot did not fully understand him,
but asked for explanations. Chevalier Rusconi then afforded
the company much pleasure by softly singing some popular
Piedmontese love songs, which he afterwards translated into
French. In the middle of one of these songs Delestang
entered the room. He had just returned from the forest,
which he had been scouring for the last two hours in search
of his wife. His strange appearance excited a general smile.
The Empress seemed to have taken a sudden friendship for
Clorinde, for she had made her sit beside her and was talking
to her about horses. Pyrame, the horse which the young
woman had been riding, was a hard goer, said the Empress;
and she promised that she should have César on the following
day.</p>

<p>On Clorinde's arrival, Rougon had gone to one of the
windows, feigning great interest in some lights which were
gleaming in the distance to the left of the park. As he stood
there no one could detect the slight quivering of his features.
He remained thus, looking out into the darkness, for a long
time, only turning when M. de Plouguern came back into the
room and stepped up to him.</p>

<p>Rougon remained quite impassive as the other whispered
in his ear, in a voice feverish with satisfied curiosity: 'There
has been a terrible scene! I followed her out of the room.
She met Marsy at the end of the corridor. They both went
into a room together, and I heard Marsy telling her roundly
that she bored him to death. She rushed out again like a
mad woman, and went off towards the Emperor's study. I
feel sure that she went to lay those famous letters on his
desk.'</p>

<p>Just at that moment Madame de Llorentz reappeared.
She was very pale; some of her hair strayed over her brow,
and she panted. However, she resumed her seat behind the
Empress with the despairing calmness of one who has just
performed on herself some terrible operation which may have
a fatal result.</p>

<p>'I'm sure she has taken the letters,' said M. de Plouguern,
examining her.</p>

<p>Then, as Rougon did not seem to understand him, he left
him; and, stooping behind Clorinde, began to tell her his
story. She listened to him with delight, her eyes sparkling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
It was not until the approach of the dinner-hour, when the
company quitted the Empress's private room, that she
appeared conscious of Rougon's presence. Then she took his
arm and said to him, as Delestang followed on behind: 'Well
now, you see——If you had been more amiable this morning,
I shouldn't have nearly broken my legs.'</p>

<p>That evening the offal of the stag was distributed by
torchlight to the hounds in the courtyard. As the guests left
the dining-room, instead of immediately returning to the
Gallery of the Maps, they dispersed through the reception
rooms in the front part of the château, where the windows
were all wide open. The Emperor took up position on the
central balcony, which afforded accommodation for a score of
other personages.</p>

<p>Down below, on either side of the courtyard, a row of footmen,
in full livery and with hair powdered, was ranged from
the steps to the gate. Each held a long staff surmounted by
a blazing cresset, in which tow had been steeped in spirits of
wine. The lofty greenish flames seemed to dance in the air,
glaring through the darkness without illuminating it, brightening
nothing except the scarlet waistcoats, to which they lent
a purplish tinge. Behind the footmen, on both sides of the
courtyard, there were numerous middle-class people of
Compiègne, whose dim faces swarmed in the darkness, the
flaring tow every now and then revealing some hideous
verdurous countenance. In the centre, in front of the steps
of the château, the offal of the stag lay in a heap. Over it
was stretched the skin of the animal, the head and antlers
lying in front. At the other end, near the gate, were the
hounds in charge of the huntsmen; and some dog-keepers, in
green livery and white cotton stockings, were waving torches.
In the bright ruddy glow, broken by clouds of smoke which
rolled away towards the town, the hounds could be seen
crowding together, and panting heavily with distended
mouths.</p>

<p>The Emperor remained standing. Every now and then a
sudden flash of torchlight showed up his blank impenetrable
face. Clorinde had watched his every movement during
dinner without detecting anything more than a melancholy
weariness, the moodiness of an invalid who suffers in silence.
Only once had she fancied that she saw him casting a faint
side-glance at M. de Marsy. And there on the balcony he still
remained moody, stooping a little and twisting his moustache,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
while behind him the guests rose upon tip-toe in order to get
a better view.</p>

<p>'Come, Firmin!' he said, almost impatiently. Then the
huntsmen sounded the 'Royale.' The hounds threw tongue,
straining their necks and rearing on their hind legs with
uproarious efforts. And, as the keeper held up the stag's
head in sight of the maddened pack, Firmin, the chief huntsman,
who stood upon the steps, let his whip drop; the
hounds, which had been waiting for this signal, bounded in
three great leaps across the courtyard, quivering and panting
with hungry excitement. Firmin, however, had picked up
his whip again; and the hounds, suddenly checked within a
few yards of the offal, squatted upon the pavement, while
their backs shook with excitement and their throats seemed
like to burst with barks of desire. But they were obliged to
retreat—to return across the courtyard and assume their
previous position by the gate.</p>

<p>'Oh, the poor animals!' said Madame de Combelot, with
an air of languid compassion.</p>

<p>'Splendid!' cried M. La Rouquette.</p>

<p>Chevalier Rusconi applauded loudly. Several of the
ladies were leaning forward in their excitement, while their
lips quivered and their hearts throbbed with desire to see the
hounds devour their prey. Would they not be allowed to
have the bones at once? they asked.</p>

<p>'No, not just yet,' said several voices.</p>

<p>Firmin had again twice dropped and then raised his whip.
The hounds were exasperated and foamed at the mouth. But
the third time, Firmin did not raise his whip again. The
valet rushed away, carrying off the stag's head and skin,
while the dogs leapt forward and seized the offal. Their
furious barking subsided into a low quivering growl of enjoyment.
Bones could be heard cracking. Then general satisfaction
was expressed upon the balcony and at the windows.
The ladies smiled in chilly fashion and clenched their white
teeth, and the men looked on with glistening eyes, while
twisting the tooth-picks they had brought from the dining-room.
In the courtyard came sudden brilliance. The huntsmen
sounded a flourish on their horns; the dog-keepers waved
their torches, and a blaze of coloured lights arose, setting the
night aflare and then raining sanguineously on the placid
heads of the townsfolk on either hand.</p>

<p>The Emperor, however, turned his back upon the scene,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and on noticing Rougon close to him, he seemed to awake
from the moody reverie in which he had been absorbed since
dinner. 'Monsieur Rougon,' he said, 'I have been thinking
about that scheme of yours. There are difficulties in the way—many
difficulties.' Then, after a momentary pause, he
opened his lips to speak again, but closed them without saying
anything. However, as he went away, he added: 'You must
remain in Paris, Monsieur Rougon.'</p>

<p>Clorinde, who heard him, made a gesture of triumph. The
Emperor's remark immediately spread through the company,
and the guests once more became grave and anxious, as
Rougon slowly made his way through their midst, towards the
Gallery of the Maps.</p>

<p>Down below in the courtyard, the hounds were finishing
their bones. They flung themselves wildly atop of one
another in order to reach the prey. With their writhing
backs, white and black, all jumbled together, they were like
a living wave, surging and struggling and roaring hungrily.
Their jaws snapped, and they bolted mouthful after mouthful
in their feverish eagerness to devour all. Quarrels, brief and
sudden, ended in a loud howl. One large hound, a magnificent
creature, finding himself too far away from the quarry, stepped
back and then sprang into the very middle of the pack. He
forced his way through the others, and soon gulped down a
great strip of the stag's entrails.</p>



<hr class="chap">
<h3><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a></h3>

<h3>RECALLED TO POWER</h3>


<p>Some weeks went by. Rougon had relapsed into his life of
lassitude and ennui. He never referred to the Emperor's
order that he should remain in Paris. He only spoke of his
disappointment and of the alleged obstacles which stood in
the way of his clearing some portion of the Landes. Upon
this topic he talked continually. What obstacles could there
possibly be? he asked. For his part, he could see none. He
even went so far as to show some irritation against the
Emperor, from whom it was impossible, he complained, to
obtain any explanations. Perhaps, however, his Majesty felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
afraid lest he should be obliged to come forward with a subvention
for the proposed expedition.</p>

<p>As the days went by, Clorinde's visits to the Rue Marbeuf
increased in frequency. She seemed every afternoon to expect
some great news from Rougon, and she gazed at him in surprise
on finding him so silent. Ever since her visit to
Compiègne she had been living in the hope of a sudden
triumph. She had pictured a series of dramatic scenes:
furious anger on the part of the Emperor, M. de Marsy's utter
fall and disgrace, and the great man's immediate restoration
to power. She no doubt imagined that her feminine wiles
would have this result; and so her astonishment was unbounded
when, at the end of a month, she still saw the Count
in office. She began to feel contempt for the Emperor, who
seemed incapable of avenging himself. What could he be
thinking about in the everlasting silence he preserved?</p>

<p>However, Clorinde had not yet abandoned all hope. She
had an intuition that some unforeseen turn of the wheel of
chance would bring round the triumph she desired, for M. de
Marsy's influence was certainly shaken. Rougon now treated
her with all the watchful attention of a jealous husband. Ever
since his strange outbreaks at Compiègne, he had exercised a
most fatherly surveillance over her, had plied her with moral
dissertations, and expressed his desire to see her every day. The
young woman smiled, feeling certain now that he would not
leave Paris. Towards the middle of December, however, after
weeks of drowsy listlessness, he again reverted to his great
scheme. He had consulted some bankers, and had hopes of
doing without the Emperor's assistance. And once more he
buried himself in maps and plans and technical treatises.
Gilquin, he said, had already enrolled more than five hundred
workmen who were willing to go out with him. They would
form the first instalment of his future people. At this
Clorinde, feeling quite provoked, again set the whole coterie
of friends in motion.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous undertaking. Each of them took
some special <i>rôle</i>; and whispered councils were held in the
corners of Rougon's own drawing-room on Sunday and
Thursday evenings. They portioned out the various difficult
matters, and every day they scattered through Paris, invincibly
determined upon gaining some influence or other to their
cause. No assistance was too insignificant for their acceptance;
the most trifling help might be useful. They availed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
themselves of everything, they drew whatever advantage they
could from the most trivial incidents, and worked and worked
from the first thing in the morning until the last thing at
night. They enlisted their friends as accomplices, and their
friends enlisted others. All Paris seemed to share in the
intrigue. In the most out-of-the-way districts people began to
yearn for Rougon's triumph, without being able to say why.
The little band, though it only comprised some ten or twelve
persons, was influencing the whole city.</p>

<p>'We are the coming government,' said Du Poizat, in all
seriousness; and, establishing a parallel between themselves
and the men who had made the Second Empire, he added:
'I shall be Rougon's Marsy.'</p>

<p>A pretender by himself was a mere name. A band of
supporters was needed to establish a government. Twenty
stout fellows of ambition are stronger than a mere principle,
and when they can combine a principle with their ambition
they become invincible. Such were Du Poizat's views. He
himself spent his time in perambulating Paris, often calling
at newspaper offices, where he smoked his cigar and did what
he could to undermine M. de Marsy's reputation. He always
had some secret little story to relate about the minister, whom
he accused of ingratitude and egotism. Then, when he had
managed to bring in Rougon's name, he would drop vague
hints and promises of the rewards and presents and subventions
which the latter would shower down upon every one
should he be in the position to do so. In this way Du Poizat
contrived to supply numerous suggestions, anecdotes, and
quotations to the newspapers, which continually brought the
great man under the notice of the public. Two journals published
an account of a visit to the house in the Rue Marbeuf,
and others spoke of Rougon's famous work on the English
constitution and that of 1852. Thus, after a hostile silence
of two years, a murmur of eulogy arose, and Rougon's popularity
seemed to be reviving. Du Poizat, too, devoted himself
to other intrigues, very secret ones, such as the purchase of
certain persons' support by a kind of gambling on the
prospects of Rougon's return to office.</p>

<p>'Let us only think of him,' he often said, with that frankness
of his which was distasteful to the more affected members
of the band. 'Later on, he will think of us.'</p>

<p>M. Beulin-d'Orchère was not a very subtle intriguer.
When he unearthed a scandalous affair to the detriment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
M. de Marsy it was immediately hushed up. He showed
greater shrewdness in hinting that he might very well become
Minister of Justice if ever his brother-in-law should return to
power, an intimation which brought all his brother judges
over to his side. M. Kahn meanwhile had put himself at the
head of another company of auxiliaries, financiers, deputies,
and functionaries, who helped to swell the army of malcontents.
He had a docile lieutenant in M. Béjuin, and even
availed himself of the services of M. de Combelot and M. La
Rouquette, without those gentlemen having the faintest idea
of the object for which he made them work. For his part, he
acted in the official world, even its highest spheres, carrying
his propaganda into the Tuileries, and covertly labouring for
days at a time in order that some remark or other might be
repeated from mouth to mouth till it reached the Emperor
himself.</p>

<p>But it was the women who manifested the most passionate
enthusiasm. There were some terribly strange underplots,
some complicated intrigues among them, whose full scope
was never known. Madame Correur began to call pretty
Madame Bouchard 'her little pet,' and took her, she said, on
a visit to the country; so that for a week M. Bouchard was
left to lead a bachelor's life, and M. d'Escorailles had to spend
his evenings at the minor theatres. Du Poizat, however, met
the two ladies one day in the company of some gentlemen
who wore decorations, but he said nothing about having done
so. Madame Correur now rented two flats: one in the Rue
Blanche, and the other in the Rue Mazarine. The latter was
very elegantly furnished, and Madame Bouchard would go
there of an afternoon, taking the key from the doorkeeper of
the house. It was said that the young woman had made an
effectual conquest of a very high functionary.</p>

<p>Then, too, the minor members of the band bestirred themselves,
doing all they could. Colonel Jobelin betook himself
regularly to a café on the boulevards to catch his old
army friends, whom he catechised between their games of
piquet; and when he had enlisted the sympathies of half a
dozen, he rubbed his hands gleefully in the evening and
declared that the whole army had joined the good cause.
M. Bouchard devoted himself to a like task in the government
offices, and gradually instilled a strong feeling of enmity
against M. de Marsy into the clerks. He even won over the
messengers, and made the whole staff sigh for the golden age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of which he hinted the advent. M. d'Escorailles, on his side,
devoted himself to the wealthy young men he knew, extolling
Rougon's broad views, his tolerance of certain misdemeanours,
and his love of daring. Even the Charbonnels, as they sat
on the benches of the Luxembourg garden, whither they
went each afternoon while awaiting the issue of their interminable
lawsuit, found a means of enlisting the sympathy
and support of the petty cits residing in the neighbourhood of
the Odéon.</p>

<p>Clorinde was not content with being the guiding spirit of
the band, but engaged in very elaborate operations of her own,
of which she never spoke. She was to be seen more frequently
than ever, hurrying through streets of questionable
repute, carelessly dressed and tightly hugging her big official-looking
portfolio, which was now so split at the seams that it
was only kept together by means of string. She also gave
her husband extraordinary commissions to perform, and he
did her bidding with the docility of a sheep, never seeking to
understand her even. Then, too, she sent Luigi Pozzo about
carrying letters; asked M. de Plouguern to give her his escort,
and then kept him waiting in the street for her by the hour.
At one moment she even thought of getting the Italian
government to interfere in Rougon's favour. Her correspondence
with her mother, who was still living at Turin, had
become extremely active. She had dreams of turning Europe
topsy-turvy, and would go twice a day to Chevalier Rusconi's
to meet his diplomatic acquaintances. In this strange campaign
of hers, she also frequently remembered her beauty, and
would go out on certain afternoons most superbly arrayed.
And when her friends, quite surprised by the change, told her
that she looked lovely, 'I have need to be,' she replied, with
an air of resigned weariness.</p>

<p>On her return from Compiègne, Du Poizat, having heard
of her adventure at the hunt, had tried to find out on what
terms she was with M. de Marsy. He had some vague idea
of betraying Rougon in favour of the Count were Clorinde
likely to become the latter's all-powerful mistress. She, however,
with considerable irritation, denied the truth of any such
supposition. He must think her very silly to suspect her of
such a connection, she said. She even gave him to understand
that she should never see M. de Marsy again. In her
earlier days she might possibly have thought of becoming his
wife. Now, however, she had other schemes in her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>'There are often many ways of getting at what you want,'
she sometimes said, 'but there is never more than one of
them that is pleasant. I myself have a craving to satisfy.'</p>

<p>When she said this she would keep her eyes fixed upon
Rougon as though she dreamt of fattening him up for some
future feast of her own. She still displayed a disciple-like
submission, however, and kept herself in the background with
cajoling humility. Rougon himself seemed quite unconscious
of all that was going on about him. In his drawing-room,
on Sundays and Thursdays, he still consulted playing cards
like a fortune-teller, bending over them, and apparently
hearing nothing of the talk that went on behind him. The
members of the band discussed his affairs, made signs to each
other over his head, and plotted by his fireside as though
he were not in the room. He seemed so unconcerned with
what they whispered that they at last began to chat in
louder tones, smiling at his absent-mindedness. However,
when they turned the conversation upon the subject of his
return to power he flew into a tantrum, and swore that he
would not move even if he knew that triumph awaited him
at the end of the street; and indeed he shut himself up
more than ever, and affected absolute ignorance of what went
on in the world. The little house in the Rue Marbeuf,
whence streamed such a flow of feverish propaganda, was
itself a silent, drowsy home, on the threshold of which
Rougon's friends cast glances at one another as a warning
to leave outside the scent of battle which they carried in
the folds of their garments.</p>

<p>Du Poizat, however, would exclaim: 'I tell you he's
drawing us all out. He listens to all we say. Just look at
his ears in the evening; you can see that they are on the
strain.'</p>

<p>This was frequently the subject of their conversation
when they went away together at half-past ten. It really
was impossible, they said, that the great man should be
unaware of their devotion. The ex-sub-prefect repeated that
he was playing the part of a Hindoo idol, squatting in a
state of self-satisfaction with his hands across his abdomen,
and smiling unctuously amidst a crowd of believers who cut
themselves to pieces in his worship. And the others allowed
that this comparison seemed a very true one.</p>

<p>'But I will keep my eye on him, you may depend upon
that,' Du Poizat said in conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>However, it was useless to study Rougon's face. It
remained blank and unruffled, almost child-like. Perhaps,
after all, there was no deception about his appearance.
Clorinde, for her part, much preferred that he should remain
inactive. She was afraid that if they compelled him to open
his eyes he might thwart their plans. They were working
for his advancement, in spite of himself, as it were. By
some means or other, forcibly if necessary, they meant to
thrust him into a position of high authority. Then they
would have a settlement.</p>

<p>Still matters seemed to advance very slowly, and the
band began to grow impatient. Du Poizat's views gained
the mastery. They did not openly reproach Rougon with all
that they were doing for him, but they assailed him with
allusions and hints. The colonel would sometimes come to
the evening receptions with his boots white with dust. He
had not had time to go home and change them, he said. He
was quite knocked up with running about on foolish errands
for which he should probably never get any thanks. On
other evenings M. Kahn, with heavy eyes, complained of the
late hours he had been compelled to keep for a month past.
He was going a great deal into society, he said, not for pleasure,
indeed, but because it enabled him to meet certain
people upon certain business. Then Madame Correur would
relate affecting stories; telling them, for instance, of some
poor young woman, a widow of the highest character, whom
she visited, but was now unable to assist. If she were the
government, she said, she would take good care to prevent
injustice. Then the whole coterie would vent its own
sorrows; each would lament his or her present situation,
and compare it with what it would have been had they not
behaved in the foolish, soft-hearted way they had done. And
all these endless complaints were accentuated by meaning
glances at Rougon. To rouse him they even went so far as
to praise M. de Marsy. At first Rougon preserved unruffled
tranquillity. He still showed no signs of understanding.
But after a few evenings, when the talk was of this kind,
slight twitchings would pass over his face at certain remarks
made in his presence. He expressed no annoyance, but
pressed his lips together as though he were pricked by some
invisible needle. And at last he became so restless and
uneasy that he gave up his card-tricks. He could no longer
accomplish them successfully, and preferred to pace about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the room, talking, and suddenly hastening away when his
friends began to launch veiled reproaches at him. Every
now and then he would turn white with anger, and seem to
be forcibly holding his hands behind his back to restrain
himself from turning the whole crew out of doors.</p>

<p>'My children,' said the colonel one evening, 'I sha'n't
come here again for a fortnight. It will be good for us to
sulk for a while and see how he can manage to amuse himself
without us.'</p>

<p>Then Rougon, who had been thinking of closing his doors,
felt very much hurt at the way in which he was abandoned.
The colonel kept his word, and some of the others followed
his example. The drawing-room looked very empty; there
were always five or six of the circle absent. When one of
them reappeared after a prolonged absence, and the great
man asked him if he had been unwell, the other merely
answered in the negative with an air of surprise, and gave no
explanation. One Thursday not a single person came.
Rougon spent the whole evening alone, pacing up and down
the big room with his hands behind him and his head bent.
For the first time he felt the strength of the chain which
linked him to his band. He shrugged his shoulders to express
his contempt for the stupidity of the Charbonnels, the
envious rage of Du Poizat, and the suspicious affection of
Madame Correur. Nevertheless, he felt a craving, the jealous
craving of a master secretly pained by their slightest infidelities,
to see and rule these friends of his, whom he held in
such light esteem. Indeed at the bottom of his heart he
was touched by their foolish behaviour and loved their faults.
They seemed to be part of his being, so that he felt
diminished and incomplete when they held aloof from him.
As they continued to absent themselves he ended by writing
to them, and even called at their residences to make peace
with them after serious tiffs. Life at the house in the Rue
Marbeuf was now so much chronic quarrelling—a series of
constantly recurring ruptures and reconciliations.</p>

<p>Towards the end of December there was a particularly
serious defection. One evening, without anyone quite knowing
why, one bitter remark led to another, and it all
ended by a very angry scene. For nearly three weeks afterwards
the meetings ceased. The truth is that the band was
beginning to lose hope. Their most earnest efforts seemed
to have no appreciable result. It was unlikely that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
general situation would change for a long time, and a sudden
catastrophe, such as might render Rougon necessary, could
hardly be anticipated. They had anxiously awaited the
opening of the Corps Législatif, but this had gone off without
any other incident than the refusal of two republican deputies
to take the oath of allegiance. M. Kahn, who was the shrewd
man of the group, no longer hoped for any advantage from
the course of general politics.</p>

<p>Rougon, in his weary irritation, was occupying himself
more energetically than ever with his Landes scheme, as
though to conceal the feverish twitchings of his face, which
he could no longer keep placid and sleepy as formerly. 'I
don't feel very well,' he sometimes said. 'My hands tremble.
My doctor has ordered me to take exercise. I am out-of-doors
all day.' He did, indeed, go out a great deal now, and was to
be met in the streets with his hands swinging and his head
in the air, absorbed in thought. When anyone stopped and
questioned him he said he had been tramping about all day.</p>

<p>One morning when he returned home to <i>déjeuner</i>, after a
walk in the direction of Chaillot, he found a gilt-edged visiting-card
awaiting him, on which was written Gilquin's name.
The card was very dirty, and bore the marks of greasy fingers.
Rougon rang for his servant. 'Did the person who gave you
this card leave any message?' he asked.</p>

<p>The servant, who was new to the house, smiled. 'It was
a gentleman in a green overcoat,' he replied. 'He was very
pleasant and offered me a cigar. He only said that he was a
friend of yours.' However, just as the servant was leaving
the room he turned and added: 'I think there's something
written on the back of the card.' Rougon turned it over and
read these words written in pencil: 'Can't wait. Will call
again this evening. Very urgent; a strange business.'
Then he threw down the card with a careless air. After
<i>déjeuner</i>, however, the expression 'Very urgent; a strange
business,' recurred to his mind and haunted him, till it at last
rendered him quite impatient. What could this 'strange
business' of Gilquin's be? Since Rougon had charged the
ex-commercial traveller with sundry obscure and intricate
commissions he had seen him regularly once a week in the
evening. Never before had Gilquin called in the morning, so
that the matter in hand must surely be something out of the
common. Rougon, quite at a loss to guess its nature, found
himself all aglow with impatience, and although he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
help feeling that it was ridiculous, he resolved to go out and
try to discover Gilquin before the evening.</p>

<p>'Some tipsy story, I dare say,' he reflected as he went
through the Champs Élysées. 'Well, at any rate I shall
satisfy myself.'</p>

<p>He was on foot, as he wished to carry out the directions
of his doctor. It was a lovely day; a bright, sunny January
noontide. Gilquin appeared to have removed from the Passage
Guttin, for his card bore the address Rue Guisarde, Faubourg
Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>Rougon had an immense amount of trouble to find this
filthy street, which is situated near Saint-Sulpice's. At the
end of a dark passage he discovered a woman lying in bed,
who called out to him in a voice which quavered with fever:
'Monsieur Gilquin! I don't know whether he's in. It's the
door on the left on the fourth floor, right up at the top.'</p>

<p>When Rougon reached the fourth floor he saw Gilquin's
name inscribed on the door amidst some arabesques representing
flaming hearts transpierced by arrows. However, he
knocked to no purpose; he could hear nothing but the tick-tack
of a cuckoo-clock and the mewing of a cat. He had
expected that he was coming on a vain errand, still he was
glad that he had come. His walk had relieved him. So he
went downstairs again, feeling more composed, and reflecting
that he could very well wait till the evening. When he got
outside he slackened his steps, crossed the Saint-Germain
market, and then went down the Rue de Seine, with no
definite goal in view, but thinking that he would walk home,
although he already felt a little tired. Then, as he reached
the Rue Jacob, he remembered the Charbonnels, who lived
there. He had not seen them for ten days. They were
sulking with him. However, he resolved to call on them for
a few minutes and offer them his hand. The afternoon was
so warm that he felt quite tender-hearted.</p>

<p>The Charbonnels' room at the Hôtel du Périgord overlooked
the yard, a gloomy well of a place which smelt like a
dirty sink. It was a large, dark room, with rickety mahogany
furniture and curtains of faded red damask. When Rougon
entered it Madame Charbonnel was folding up her dresses
and laying them in a big trunk, while her husband perspired
and strained his arms in cording another trunk, a smaller
one.</p>

<p>'Halloa! are you off?' Rougon asked, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' answered Madame Charbonnel, drawing a
deep sigh. 'This time we've quite made up our minds.'</p>

<p>However, they gave him a hearty welcome, apparently
quite flattered at seeing him in their room. All the chairs
were littered with clothes, bundles of linen, and baskets with
splitting sides. So Rougon sat down on the edge of the bed.
'Oh, don't trouble yourselves!' he said, good-naturedly;
'I'm very comfortable here. Go on with what you're doing;
I don't want to disturb you. Are you going by the eight
o'clock train?'</p>

<p>'Yes, by the eight o'clock train,' M. Charbonnel replied.
'That gives us just six more hours to spend in this beastly
Paris. Ah! we sha'n't forget it in a hurry, Monsieur
Rougon!'</p>

<p>Then he, who generally spoke so little, launched into a
flow of bitter invective, and even shook his fist at the window
while declaiming against the horrid city, where one actually
couldn't see clearly in one's room at two o'clock in the afternoon.
That dirty light which filtered in through that narrow
well of a yard was Paris! But, thank Heaven, he was going
to see the sun again in his garden at Plassans! Then he
looked round to make sure that he was forgetting nothing.
He had bought a railway time-table in the morning, and he
pointed to a cold roast fowl wrapt in some greasy paper, which
they meant to take with them to eat on their journey.</p>

<p>'Have you emptied everything out of the drawers, my
dear?' he asked. 'My slippers were in the night-table. I
think, too, that some papers fell behind the chest of drawers.'</p>

<p>Rougon felt pained as he watched the preparations of
these disconsolate old folks, whose hands trembled as they
made up their packages. Their emotion seemed to him like
a silent reproach. It was he who had kept them in Paris,
and their sojourn there was ending in complete failure,
a veritable flight.</p>

<p>'You are making a mistake,' he said at last.</p>

<p>But Madame Charbonnel answered with a gesture of
entreaty as if to beseech him to be silent. 'Don't make us
any promises, Monsieur Rougon,' she said sharply. 'They
could only bring all our unhappiness over again. When I
think that we've been here for two years and a half! Two
years and a half, good heavens, in this hole of a place! My
left leg will never be free from pain again as long as I live. I
have slept on the far side of the bed, and that wall behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
you fairly streams with water at night. Oh, I couldn't tell
you all we've gone through! It would be too long a story.
And we've spent a ruinous amount of money! Only yesterday
I was obliged to buy this big trunk to carry away the
things we have worn out while we have been in Paris; the
wretchedly sewn clothes, which the shopkeepers charged us
most extortionately for, and the linen which came back from
the laundress's in rags. Ah! I sha'n't be sorry to have seen
the last of your laundresses! They ruin everything with
their acids.'</p>

<p>Then she threw a bundle of things into the trunk, and
exclaimed: 'No, this time we are certainly going. I think
it would kill me to stay here an hour longer.'</p>

<p>Rougon, however, insisted upon talking about their lawsuit.
Had they had any bad news? he asked. Then the
Charbonnels told him, almost crying as they did so, that the
property of their cousin Chevassu was certainly lost to them.
The Council of State was on the point of authorising the
Sisters of the Holy Family to receive the legacy of five
hundred thousand francs. Their last remaining hope had
expired on hearing of the arrival of Monseigneur Rochart in
Paris, whither he had come, for the second time, to hurry the
matter forward.</p>

<p>And all at once M. Charbonnel ceased to struggle with the
cords of the smaller trunk and raised his arms convulsively,
while crying in a broken voice: 'Five hundred thousand
francs! Five hundred thousand francs!'</p>

<p>They both seemed overwhelmed. They sat down, the
husband on the trunk and the wife on a bundle of linen,
amidst all the litter of the room. And they began to pity
themselves in a mournful strain; as soon as one stopped the
other began. They recalled their affection for their cousin
Chevassu. How fond they had been of him! As a matter
of fact, they had not seen him for more than seventeen years
before his death. But, just now, they wept over him in all
good faith, and really believed that they had shown him every
kind attention during his illness. Then they began to accuse
the Sisters of the Holy Family of disgraceful scheming.
They had brought undue influence to bear on cousin Chevassu,
they had kept him from his friends, and had exerted constant
pressure on his mind, which illness had weakened. Madame
Charbonnel, though she was really a very devout woman,
went so far as to relate a dreadful story, according to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
cousin Chevassu had died of fright after signing his will at
the dictation of a priest, who had shewn him the devil standing
at the foot of his bed. And as for the Bishop of Faverolles,
she said, it was a dirty part that he was playing, in
despoiling a couple of honest people, who were esteemed
throughout Plassans for the integrity they had shown in
getting a little competency together in the oil trade.</p>

<p>'But perhaps the case isn't hopeless yet,' said Rougon,
seeing that they were wavering. 'Monseigneur Rochart isn't
the Divinity. I myself haven't been able to do anything for
you lately; I've had so much else to occupy me. But let me
find out exactly how matters stand. I don't mean to let
them prey on us.'</p>

<p>The Charbonnels looked at each other and shrugged their
shoulders. 'It's really no use troubling about it, Monsieur
Rougon,' murmured the husband.</p>

<p>And as Rougon persisted, swearing that he would make
every effort in their favour, and could not let them go off in
this way, the wife in her turn said: 'It's really no use your
troubling yourself about it. You would only give yourself a
lot of bother for nothing. We spoke of you to our lawyer, but
he only laughed at us, and said you had no power now against
Monseigneur Rochart.'</p>

<p>'And if you've no power, what's the good of troubling
yourself?' asked M. Charbonnel. 'We had much better give
it up.'</p>

<p>Rougon had bent his head. These remarks cut him like
lashes. Never before had his powerlessness brought him such
cruel pain.</p>

<p>'No; we are going back to Plassans,' continued Madame
Charbonnel. 'It is much the wisest thing to do. But we are
not going away with any grudge against you, Monsieur
Rougon! When we see Madame Félicité, your mother, we
shall tell her that you would have cut yourself in pieces for
us. And if anyone else questions us you may be sure that
we sha'n't say a word against you. Nobody can be expected
to do more than he's able, can he?'</p>

<p>This was the last stroke. Rougon pictured the Charbonnels
reaching their distant home in the provinces. As soon
as they had told their news the little town would be yelping at
him. It would be a personal defeat, from which it would
take him years to recover.</p>

<p>'But you must stay here!' he exclaimed. 'I will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
you stay. We will see if Monseigneur Rochart can gobble me
up at a mouthful!'</p>

<p>He broke into a threatening laugh which quite alarmed
the Charbonnels. They continued to resist for some time,
and then at last consented to remain in Paris for another
week, but not a single day longer. And thereupon M. Charbonnel
began to unknot the cords which he had fastened
about the smaller trunk, and his wife lighted a candle,
although it was scarcely three o'clock, in order that she might
see to put the linen and clothes in the drawers again. When
Rougon left them he pressed their hands affectionately and
renewed his promises to do all he could.</p>

<p>Before he had gone ten yards down the street, however,
he already began to repent of what he had done. Why had
he persuaded the Charbonnels to stay when they were so
anxious to be off? It would have been a first-rate opportunity
to get rid of them. And now he was more committed than
ever to bring about a successful issue of their suit. He was
especially vexed with himself for the motives of vanity which,
as he realised, had influenced him. They seemed unworthy
of a man of strength. However, he had promised, and must
do what he could. Thus thinking he went down the Rue
Bonaparte, followed the quay, and then crossed the Saints-Pères
bridge.</p>

<p>The weather was still mild, but a rather sharp breeze was
blowing along the river. Rougon was half-way across and
was buttoning his coat when he saw a stout lady in furs
immediately in front of him. It was Madame Correur; he
recognised her by her voice.</p>

<p>'Ah! is it you?' she said in a mournful tone. 'Well, as
I've met you I'll shake hands with you; but you wouldn't
have seen me at your house for another week. You haven't
been acting like a friend.'</p>

<p>Then she began to reproach him for not having made an
application which she had been asking of him for months past.
It was still the case of that Mademoiselle Herminie Billecoq,
a former pupil of Saint Denis, whom her seducer, an officer,
was willing to marry, if some good soul would only give her
the regulation dowry. Then, too, added Madame Correur, the
other ladies gave her no peace. The widow Leturc was
anxiously waiting for her tobacco shop, and the others,
Madame Chardon, Madame Testanière, and Madame Jalaguier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
called on her every day to relate their woes and remind her of
the promises she had made them.</p>

<p>'I was counting upon you when I made them,' she said, in
conclusion. 'Oh, you've left me in a nice hole! Well, I'm
now on my way to ask the Minister of Public Instruction
for a scholarship for little Jalaguier. You promised me that
scholarship, you know.'</p>

<p>She heaved a deep sigh as she continued: 'We are obliged
to go tramping about all over the place now that you refuse
to do anything for us.'</p>

<p>Rougon, whom the wind was slightly inconveniencing,
had bent his shoulders and begun to look at the Port Saint
Nicholas below the bridge. As he listened to Madame
Correur he watched some men unloading a barge laden with
sugar-loaves, which they rolled down a gangway formed of a
couple of planks. A crowd of three hundred people or so was
viewing the operation from the quays.</p>

<p>'I am nobody now, and I can do nothing,' said the great
man. 'It is wrong of you to feel a grudge against me.'</p>

<p>'Stuff and nonsense!' replied Madame Correur scoffingly;
'I know you well enough. Whenever you choose you can be
what you like. Don't be a humbug, Eugène!'</p>

<p>Rougon could not help smiling. The familiarity shown by
Madame Mélanie, as he had called her in former days, brought
back recollections of the Hôtel Vanneau, when he had no
boots even to his feet, but was conquering France. He forgot
all the reproaches which he had addressed to himself on
leaving the Charbonnels. 'Well, well,' he said, good-naturedly,
'what is it you have to tell me? But don't let us
stand here. It's almost freezing. As you are going to the
Rue de Grenelle I will walk with you to the end of the
bridge.'</p>

<p>Then he turned and walked along beside Madame Correur,
without, however, offering her his arm; and the lady began
to tell him her troubles at great length. 'After all,' said she,
'I don't so much mind about the others. Those ladies can
very well wait. I shouldn't bother you, I should be as merry
as I used to be—you remember, don't you?—if I hadn't such
big troubles of my own. One can't help getting bitter over
them. I'm still dreadfully bothered about my brother. Poor
Martineau! His wife has made him completely mad; he has
no feelings left.'</p>

<p>Then she gave a minute account of a fresh attempt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
reconciliation which she had made during the previous week.
In order, said she, to find out exactly what her brother's
disposition towards her might be, she had sent him as
ambassador one of her friends, that very Herminie Billecoq,
whose marriage she had been trying to effect for the last
two years.</p>

<p>'Her travelling expenses cost me a hundred and seventeen
francs,' she continued. 'But how do you think they received
her? Why, Madame Martineau sprang between her and my
brother, foaming at the mouth and crying out that I was
sending a crew of street-walkers to them, and that she would
have them arrested by the gendarmes. My poor Herminie
was still in such a tremble when I met her on her return at
the Montparnasse station that we were obliged to go into a
café and drink something.'</p>

<p>They had now reached the end of the bridge. The
passers-by were jostling them. Rougon tried to console
Madame Correur, thinking of all the kind things that he
could say. 'It's extremely annoying. But, you'll see, your
brother will make it up with you by-and-bye. Time puts
everything straight.'</p>

<p>Then, as she still detained him at the corner of the footway,
amidst the uproar of the passing vehicles, he slowly
walked up the bridge again, she following and saying: 'When
Martineau dies, his wife is quite capable of burning any will
he may leave behind him. The poor, dear fellow is nothing
more than skin and bones. Herminie says that he looks
dreadfully ill. I am terribly bothered about it all.'</p>

<p>'Well, you can do nothing now,' said Rougon, with a
vague gesture; 'you must wait.'</p>

<p>However, she stopped him again when he was half-way
across the bridge, and, lowering her voice, continued:
'Herminie told me a strange thing. It seems that Martineau
has gone in for politics now. He is a Republican. At the last
elections he threw the whole neighbourhood into excitement.
That news gave me quite a shock. He might get into
trouble, eh?'</p>

<p>There was a short pause, during which Madame Correur
looked searchingly at Rougon. He had glanced at a passing
carriage as though he wished to avoid her gaze. Then, with
an innocent air, he responded: 'Oh, don't make yourself
uneasy. You have friends, haven't you? Well, rely on
them.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>'You are the only person I rely on, Eugène,' she replied in
a low, tender voice.</p>

<p>At this Rougon seemed moved. He glanced at her, and
was stirred by the sight of her plump neck and painted face,
which she struggled to keep beautiful. She personified his
youth. 'Yes, rely on me,' he said, pressing her hands. 'You
know very well that I am always on your side.'</p>

<p>He again accompanied her as far as the Quai Voltaire.
And when she had left him he at last made his way across the
bridge, slackening his steps as he went in order to watch the
landing of the sugar-loaves at the Port Saint-Nicholas. For a
moment even he halted and let his elbows rest on the parapet.
But the sugar-loaves rolling down the gangway, the greenish
water flowing beneath the arches of the bridge, the crowd
of idlers and the houses all soon grew hazy and disappeared,
and he fell into a reverie. He became absorbed in dim,
strange thoughts; it seemed to him as if he were descending
with Madame Correur into some black abyss of human
iniquity. However, he felt no regrets, no qualms; he dreamt
of becoming very great and very powerful, so that he might
satisfy the desires of those about him to an extent unnatural—even,
as it were, impossible.</p>

<p>A shiver roused him from his quiescence. He was
trembling with cold. The night was falling and the breeze
from the river was stirring up cloudlets of white dust on the
quays. He felt very tired as he made his way alongside the
Tuileries, and suddenly lacked the courage to return home on
foot. All the passing cabs were full, however, and he had
almost relinquished the hope of securing one when he saw a
driver pull up his horse just in front of him. A head was
thrust out of the window of the vehicle. It was M. Kahn's.
'I was just going to your house. Get in. I will drive you
home, and we can talk as we go.'</p>

<p>Rougon got into the cab, and was scarcely seated before
the ex-deputy burst into tempestuous words amidst the jolting
of the vehicle as its horse went on at a sleepy trot: 'Ah, my
friend,' said M. Kahn, 'I have just had such a proposal made
to me! You would never be able to guess it! I feel as
though I were choking!' Then he lowered one of the
windows, adding: 'You have no objection, have you?'</p>

<p>Rougon lay back in a corner of the cab, watching the
grey wall of the Tuileries gardens; while M. Kahn, very red in
the face, and gesticulating spasmodically, continued: 'I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
been following your advice, you know. For the last two
years I have been struggling persistently. I have seen the
Emperor three times, and I have reached my fourth petition
on the subject. If I haven't succeeded in getting the railway
grant for myself, I have, at any rate, prevented Marsy from
getting it for the Western Company. Briefly, I manœuvred
so as to keep matters at a standstill till we should be the
stronger party again, as you advised me to do.'</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment, as his voice was drowned by
the dreadful clatter made by a passing cart laden with iron.
When the cab had got clear of this cart he continued: 'Well,
just now, while I was sitting in my study, a man whom I
don't know, but who is a big contractor, it appears, called on
me and calmly proposed, in the name of Marsy and the
directors of the Western Railway Company, that if I would
make a million francs' worth of shares over to those gentlemen
I should be granted the necessary authorisation for my
line. What do you think of that?'</p>

<p>'The terms are a little high,' said Rougon, with a smile.</p>

<p>M. Kahn jerked his head and crossed his arms.</p>

<p>'Oh, you've no idea of the coolness of these people,' he
continued. 'You ought to have heard the whole of my conversation
with the contractor. In consideration of the million's
worth of shares Marsy undertakes to support me, and to bring
my claim to a successful issue within a month's time. When
I began to speak of the Emperor the contractor only laughed,
and told me plumply that if the Emperor was my support I
might as well give the whole thing up at once.'</p>

<p>The cab was now turning into the Place de la Concorde,
and Rougon emerged from his corner with a bright colour on
his cheeks, as if suddenly warmed. 'And did you show this
fine gentleman the door?' he asked.</p>

<p>The ex-deputy did not immediately answer, but looked at
him with an expression of great surprise. M. Kahn's anger
had abruptly subsided. For a while he lay back in his corner
of the cab and yielded to the jolts. Then he muttered: 'Ah,
no; one doesn't show people like that to the door without a
little reflection. And, besides, I wanted to take your advice.
For my own part, I confess I am inclined to accept the
offer.'</p>

<p>'Never, Kahn!' cried Rougon hotly. 'Never!'</p>

<p>Then they began to discuss the matter. M. Kahn quoted
figures. No doubt, said he, a commission of a million francs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
was an enormous one, but he showed that it might easily be
balanced by following certain methods. Rougon, however,
refused to listen, and waved his hand to silence him. He
himself held money in little account; if he was unwilling
that Marsy should pocket a million it was because the gift of
that million would be a confession of his own powerlessness,
an acknowledgment that he himself was beaten, and that the
influence of his rival was so much greater than his own that
it might really be priced at that exorbitant figure.</p>

<p>'Can't you see that Marsy is getting tired of the struggle?'
said he. 'He's coming round. Wait a little longer and we
shall get the grant for nothing.' Then, in almost threatening
tones, he added: 'I warn you that we shall quarrel if
you accept. I cannot allow a friend of mine to be fleeced in
that manner.'</p>

<p>A pause followed. The cab was now ascending the
Champs Élysées. Both men, wrapped in thought, looked as
though they were counting the trees in the side avenues.
M. Kahn was the first to break the silence. 'Listen to me
now,' he said in a low tone. 'I ask nothing better than to
keep on with you, but you must acknowledge that for the last
two years——'</p>

<p>Then he stopped; and, instead of finishing the sentence
he had begun, he gave another turn to his answer: 'Well, it
isn't your fault. Just now your hands are tied. We had
better give them the million; believe me, we had.'</p>

<p>'Never!' cried Rougon energetically. 'In a fortnight
you shall have your grant; in a fortnight, do you hear
me?'</p>

<p>The cab had just stopped in front of the little house in
the Rue Marbeuf. Neither of them alighted, however. For
some moments they continued talking inside the vehicle,
as though comfortably ensconced in their own home. M.
Bouchard and Colonel Jobelin were coming to dine that
evening with Rougon, and he pressed M. Kahn to join them;
but the other, to his great regret, he said, was obliged to
decline the invitation, as he was engaged elsewhere. The
great man was now enthusiastically determined upon obtaining
the railway grant. When he at length alighted from the
cab he closed the door in a friendly way and gave the ex-deputy
a parting nod.</p>

<p>'Till next Thursday, then?' cried the latter, thrusting
his head out of the window as the cab drove off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Rougon was feeling slightly feverish on his return. He
could not even read the evening papers. Although it was
scarcely five o'clock, he went straight to the drawing-room
and began to walk up and down while waiting for his guests.
The first sunshine of the year, though it was only a pale
January sunshine, had given him a touch of headache. His
afternoon had left a very vivid impression upon him. All
his friends rose before him: those whom he put up with,
those of whom he felt afraid, and those for whom he had a
genuine affection. They all seemed to be goading him on,
forcing him to some decisive step. And this did not displease
him; he felt that their impatience was reasonable,
and he realised that an anger akin to their own was rising up
within himself. It was as though the ground in front of him
had gradually diminished, as if the time was near when he
would be compelled to make a formidable leap.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly thought of Gilquin, whom he had
entirely forgotten. He rang for his servant to ask if 'the
gentleman in the green overcoat' had called again during
his absence. But the servant had seen no one. Then
Rougon told him that if Gilquin should call during the
evening he was to be shown into his study. 'And you will
let me know immediately,' he added, 'even if we are at
table.'</p>

<p>His curiosity was again roused, and he went to look for
Gilquin's card. He read the inscription, 'Very urgent; a
strange business,' several times over, without managing to
make anything of it. When M. Bouchard and the colonel
arrived he slipped the card into his pocket, feeling disturbed,
even irritated, by those words, which kept buzzing in his
brain.</p>

<p>The dinner was a very plain one. M. Bouchard had been
a bachelor for the last two days, his wife having had to go
into the provinces on a visit to a sick aunt, of whom,
strangely enough, she had never previously spoken. The
colonel, for whom there was always a cover laid at Rougon's
table, had that evening brought his son, whose holidays were
on just then. Madame Rougon did the honours in her
kindly silent fashion. Under her ever-vigilant eyes the
repast was served, slowly, but most carefully, and without
the slightest noise. The conversation turned upon the
subjects of study in the public schools. The chief clerk
quoted some lines from Horace, and spoke of the prizes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
had gained in the examinations, about 1813. The colonel
said he would have liked a more military form of discipline
among the pupils; and then he went on to explain why
Auguste had failed in his examination for a bachelor's degree
in November. The youth had such a lively intelligence, he
said, that he always went beyond the questions asked by the
examiners, and this had annoyed them. While his father
was thus explaining his failure, Auguste himself was eating
some fowl, with a sly smile on his beaming dunce's face.</p>

<p>They were at dessert, when the sound of a bell in the hall
caused Rougon the greatest emotion, and quite distracted his
attention from his guests. He felt sure that the ring was
Gilquin's, and sharply raised his eyes to the door, already
mechanically folding up his napkin in the expectation of being
summoned from the room. But when the door opened, it was
Du Poizat who appeared. The ex-sub-prefect dropped into a
chair at a few feet from the table, as though he were quite at
home. He often called like this early in the evening, immediately
after his dinner, which he took at a little boarding-house
in the Faubourg Saint Honoré.</p>

<p>'I'm quite done up,' he said, without giving any particulars
of the intricate business which he had been transacting during
the afternoon. 'I should have gone straight to bed, but I felt
an inclination to come and glance over the papers. They are
in your room, I suppose, Rougon, aren't they?'</p>

<p>He stayed where he was, however, and accepted a pear
and half a glass of wine. The conversation then turned upon
the high price of provisions, which had doubled, it was said,
during the last twenty years; M. Bouchard mentioning that
he could remember having seen pigeons sold at fifteen sous
the couple when he was young. However, as soon as the
liqueurs and coffee had been handed round, Madame Rougon
quietly disappeared, and the men went into the drawing-room
without her. They all seemed quite at home. The colonel
and the chief-clerk carried the card-table in front of the fire,
and began to shuffle the cards, already preparing some wonderful
combinations. Auguste sat down at a side table and
turned over some numbers of an illustrated newspaper. Du
Poizat had disappeared.</p>

<p>'Just look at the hand I hold,' exclaimed the colonel
abruptly. 'Isn't it a strange one?'</p>

<p>Rougon went up to the table and nodded. Then, when he
had returned to his chair in silence, and was taking up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
tongs to move some of the logs of the fire, the servant came in
very quietly, and said in his ear: 'The gentleman who called
this morning is here.'</p>

<p>Rougon started. He had not heard the bell. When he
went into his study, he found Gilquin standing there with a
rattan cane under his arm, whilst, with a professional blinking
of the eyes, he examined a somewhat poor engraving of
Napoleon at Saint Helena. Gilquin's long green overcoat
was buttoned up to his chin, and he had not even doffed his
black silk hat, which looked almost new, and was tilted very
much on one side.</p>

<p>'Well?' asked Rougon hastily.</p>

<p>Gilquin, however, seemed in no hurry, but jogged his
head while looking at the engraving, and saying: 'It's well
expressed. How dreadfully bored he looks, doesn't he?'</p>

<p>The room was lighted by a single lamp, which stood on a
corner of the writing-table. As Rougon entered, a slight
noise, a gentle rustling of paper, had come from behind a
high-backed arm-chair which stood in front of the mantelpiece,
but then such perfect silence had fallen that the previous
sound might have been thought the mere cracking of some
half-extinguished piece of firewood. Gilquin declined to take
a seat; so he and Rougon remained standing near the door,
in a patch of shadow cast by a bookcase.</p>

<p>'Well?' Rougon asked again; and then he mentioned
that he had called in the Rue Guisarde during the afternoon.</p>

<p>At this Gilquin began to speak of his doorkeeper, an excellent
woman, who was, unfortunately, dying of consumption,
which she had contracted owing to the dampness of the
ground floor of the house.</p>

<p>'But this important piece of business of yours? What is
it?' asked the great man impatiently.</p>

<p>'Oh, wait a moment,' rejoined the other, 'I have come
about that. I'll tell you about it directly. But did you go
upstairs, and did you hear my cat? It's a cat that came in
by way of the roof. One night, when my window was open,
I found her lying by my side. She was licking my beard. It
seemed very droll, and so I kept her.'</p>

<p>Then, at last, he made up his mind to speak of the particular
business which had brought him there. It was a long
story.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He commenced by relating his amours with an ironing-girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
with whom he had fallen in love one evening, as he was
coming out of the Ambigu Theatre. Poor Eulalie, he said,
had been distrained upon by her landlord, when only five
instalments of her rent were due. For the last ten days, therefore,
she had been staying at a lodging-house in the Rue
Montmartre, near her work, and it was there that he himself
had been sleeping all the week, the room being on the second
floor, a dark little place at the far end of a passage, which
overlooked a yard.</p>

<p>All this did not interest Rougon, still he listened with
patient resignation.</p>

<p>'Well, three days ago,' continued Gilquin, 'I brought
a cake and a bottle of wine with me in the evening. We ate
the cake and drank the wine in bed. A little before midnight,
Eulalie got up to shake out the crumbs; and then she went
soundly to sleep. She sleeps like a log. I, myself, was lying
awake. I had blown out the candle, and was staring up into
the darkness, when I heard a dispute in the next room. I
ought to tell you that between the two rooms there's a door
which has been fastened up. After a time the voices quieted
down and peace seemed to have been made; but I still
heard such singular sounds that at last I got out of bed and
fixed my eye to a crack in the door. Well, you'll never guess
what I saw then!'</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment, and gazed at Rougon, revelling
in the effect which he thought he was producing.</p>

<p>'There were two men there: a young one of about five-and-twenty,
who was fairly good looking; and another who
must have turned fifty, short and thin, and of sickly appearance.
Well, they were examining a collection of pistols and
daggers and swords, all kinds of brand new weapons which
glistened in the light. They were talking in a jargon which
I did not recognise at first, but afterwards, by certain words
I heard, I knew it was Italian. I've travelled in Italy, you
know, in the macaroni trade. Well, I strained my ear to
listen, and then I understood, my dear fellow. Those gentlemen
have come to Paris to assassinate the Emperor! There,
what do you think of that?'</p>

<p>Then he crossed his arms and pressed his cane to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
breast as he kept on repeating: 'It's a funny business, isn't
it?'</p>

<p>So this was Gilquin's strange affair! Rougon shrugged
his shoulders. Twenty times before had various conspiracies
been reported to him.</p>

<p>'You told me to come and tell you all the gossip of the
neighbourhood,' resumed the ex-commercial traveller. 'Well,
I want to render you all the service I can, and so I tell you all I
hear. It is wrong of you to shake your head like that. Do
you think if I had gone to the prefecture that they would have
sent me away without a nice little gratuity? But I prefer
benefiting my friends. I tell you that the matter is really
serious. So go and tell it to the Emperor, and just see how
he embraces you.'</p>

<p>For the last three days, Gilquin had been keeping a watch
over those fine gentlemen as he called them. During the
daytime, two others made their appearance, a young man,
and another of mature years, with a pale, handsome face and
long black hair, who seemed to be the chief.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They all looked
tired out when they entered the room, and they talked
together in brief, guarded phrases. However, on the previous
night, Gilquin had seen them filling some little iron 'machines'
which he believed were bombs. He had got Eulalie's key,
and had taken off his boots and kept a careful watch in the
room, listening to every sound. In the evening he so managed
matters that Eulalie began to snore at about nine o'clock,
which, he had thought, would prevent the others from feeling
any suspicion; besides, it was never prudent, he added, to let
a woman have any share in political matters.</p>

<p>As Gilquin went on speaking, a grave expression came
over Rougon's face. He was beginning to believe the story.
Beneath the ex-bagman's vinous hilarity, amid the odd details
mingled with the narrative, he felt that there was a basis of
positive truth. And then all his irksome expectation during
the day, all his anxious curiosity appeared to him in the light
of a presentiment, and he again experienced that inward
trembling which he had felt every now and then since the
morning; the involuntary emotion, as it were, of a strong man
when he realises that his fortune depends upon a single card.
However, he affected utter indifference: 'A set of imbeciles
who must have the whole detective force watching them,' he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Gilquin began to grin. 'The police had better lose no
time, then,' he rejoined.</p>

<p>Then he became silent, but he still smiled and gently tapped
his hat. The great man realised that he had not been told
everything, and looked at Gilquin searchingly. However, the
other opened the door to take his leave. 'Well, at any rate, I
have given you warning,' he said. 'I'm going to dine now,
my good fellow. I've had no dinner yet; I've been playing
the spy on my men all the afternoon, and I'm tremendously
hungry.'</p>

<p>At this Rougon stopped him, saying that he could let him
have some cold meat; and forthwith he ordered a cover to be
laid for him in the dining-room. Gilquin seemed quite
touched by this attention. He once more closed the study
door, and, lowering his voice so that the servant should not
hear him, said to Rougon: 'You are a good fellow. Listen
to me, now. I don't want to tell you any lies. If you had
received me badly, I should have gone straight to the prefecture.
But, now, I'll tell you everything. That's honest, isn't
it? I'm sure you won't forget the service I'm rendering you.
Friends are friends, whatever people may say.' Then he
leant forward and continued in a whisper: 'It is to come off
to-morrow night. They are going to blow Badinguet<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> up in
front of the Opera-house when he arrives there. The carriage
and the aides-de-camp and the whole lot will be clean swept
away.'</p>

<p>While Gilquin sat down to his meal in the dining-room,
Rougon remained standing in the middle of his study, perfectly
still and with an ashy face. He was deep in thought,
and seemed to be hesitating. At length he sat down at his
writing-table and took up a sheet of paper, but he tossed it
aside again almost immediately. For a moment it seemed as
if he were going to rush to the door and give an order. Then
he slowly came back and again became absorbed in thought,
which cast a shrouding gloom over his face.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the high-backed arm-chair in front
of the fire-place moved, and Du Poizat stood up, calmly folding
a newspaper.</p>

<p>'What! were you there?' cried Rougon roughly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>'Of course; I have been reading the papers,' replied the
ex-sub-prefect, with a smile which revealed his irregular white
teeth. 'You knew very well I was there; you saw me when
you came in.'</p>

<p>This audacious falsehood cut all explanation short. The
two men looked at each other for some moments in silence.
Then, as Rougon seemed to consult him with his eyes, and
again went towards the writing-table, Du Poizat made a little
gesture, which plainly signified: 'Wait a minute; there is
no hurry. We must consider matters.' Not a word was exchanged
between them, they both went back to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Such an angry dispute had broken out that evening between
the colonel and M. Bouchard, on the subject of the Orleans
Princes and the Count de Chambord, that they had banged
their cards down, and sworn that they would never play with
each other again. And then with glowering eyes they had
seated themselves on either side of the fire-place. However,
when Rougon returned, they were once more making friends
by loudly singing the great man's praises: that being the
one subject on which they could agree.</p>

<p>'Oh, I feel no constraint about it; I say it before his face,'
the colonel continued. 'There is no one to equal him at the
present time.'</p>

<p>'We are speaking ill of you, you hear,' said M. Bouchard,
with a cunning smile.</p>

<p>Then the conversation went on:</p>

<p>'A brain far above the average.'</p>

<p>'A man of action, who has the <i>coup d'œil</i> of born conquerors.'</p>

<p>'Ah! France wants his help sadly just now.'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed. He could do something to get us out of the
mess. He is the only man who can save the Empire.'</p>

<p>As Rougon heard this his shoulders bent, and he affected
a surly air by way of modesty. Such incense was, however,
extremely pleasant to him. His vanity was never so delightfully
titillated as when the colonel and M. Bouchard bandied
laudatory phrases like these about for a whole evening. They
talked a great deal of obvious nonsense, and their faces wore
gravely ridiculous expressions; but the more they grovelled in
their language the more did Rougon enjoy hearing their
monotonous voices as they sang his praises and lavished
altogether inapplicable commendation upon him. He sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
made fun of them when they were not there, but,
for all that, his pride and craving for power found gratification
in their eulogies. They formed, as it were, a dunghill
of praise in which his huge frame could wallow at its
ease.</p>

<p>'No, no; I am only a weak sort of man,' he said, shaking
his head. 'If I were really all that you believe——'</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence, but sat down at the card-table
and began to consult the cards, a thing which he now
seldom did. Meanwhile M. Bouchard and the colonel continued
to belaud him. They declared that he was a great
orator, a great administrator, a great financier, and a great
politician. Du Poizat, who had remained standing, nodded
his head assentingly; and presently, without looking at
Rougon, and as though the latter had not been present, he
remarked: '<i>Mon Dieu</i>! Only the least thing is needed to
bring him into power again. The Emperor is most favourably
disposed towards him. If some catastrophe were to
happen to-morrow, and the Emperor should feel the need of
an energetic hand, why by the day after to-morrow Rougon
would be minister—that's the long and short of it.'</p>

<p>The great man slowly raised his eyes. Then he dropped
back in his chair, leaving his combinations with the cards
unfinished, while his face again clouded over. But the untiring
flattery of M. Bouchard and the colonel still rang out
amidst his reverie as if to spur him on to some resolution
from which he yet recoiled. And at last a smile appeared
upon his face as young Auguste, who had just completed the
abandoned <i>réussite</i> with the cards, exclaimed: 'It has come
out all right, Monsieur Rougon.'</p>

<p>'Of course! things always come all right,' said Du Poizat,
repeating the great man's favourite phrase.</p>

<p>However, at that moment a servant entered and told
Rougon that a gentleman and a lady wished to see him. And
he handed him a card, at the sight of which Rougon uttered
a slight cry. 'What! Are they in Paris?'</p>

<p>The visitors were the Marquis and Marchioness
d'Escorailles. Rougon hastened to receive them in his
study. They apologised for the lateness of their visit; and,
in the course of conversation, gave him to understand that
they had been in Paris for a couple of days past, but had
feared lest a visit from them to one so closely connected with
the Emperor might be misconstrued; hence they had preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
to make their call quite privately and at this somewhat
unseemly hour. The explanation in no way offended Rougon.
The presence of the Marquis and Marchioness under his roof
was an unhoped-for honour. If the Emperor himself had
knocked at his door, he would not have felt more gratification.
Those old people coming to ask a favour of him typified all
Plassans offering him its homage; that aristocratic, cold and
haughty Plassans, which had ever seemed to him a sort of
inaccessible Olympus. An old ambitious dream was at last
being realised, and he felt that he was avenged for the scorn
shown him by the little town when, as a briefless advocate,
he had dragged his worn-down boots about its ill-paved
streets.</p>

<p>'We did not find Jules at home,' said the Marchioness
d'Escorailles. 'We were looking forward with pleasure to
giving him a surprise. But he has been obliged to go to
Orleans on business, it seems.'</p>

<p>Rougon was not aware of the young man's absence; however,
he quite understood it on recalling the circumstance that
the aunt whom Madame Bouchard had gone to see lived at
Orleans. Nevertheless he justified Jules, saying that it was a
serious matter, a question of abuse of power, which had
necessitated his journey. Then he told them that their son
was a very intelligent young man and had a great future
before him.</p>

<p>'It is necessary for him to make his way,' said the Marquis,
thus lightly alluding to the ruin of the family. 'It was a
great trial to us to part with him.'</p>

<p>Then he and his wife in discreet fashion began to deplore
the necessities of those degenerate times which prevented sons
from growing up in the faith of their parents. They themselves
had never set foot in Paris since the fall of Charles X.;
and they would not have come there now if it had not been a
question of Jules's future. Since their dear boy, with their
secret consent, had taken service under the Empire, they had
pretended to deny him before the world, but in reality they
were continually striving for his advancement.</p>

<p>'We make no pretence with you, Monsieur Rougon,' said
the Marquis, in a tone of charming familiarity. 'We love our
boy; it is natural we should. You have done a great deal for
him already, and we thank you heartily for it. But we want
you to do more still. We are friends and fellow-townsmen,
are we not?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Rougon bowed, feeling much moved. The humble demeanour
of those old people whom he had seen so majestic when
they repaired on Sundays to the church of Saint Marc, seemed
to enhance his own importance. He gave them formal promises
of help.</p>

<p>As they were going off, after twenty minutes' friendly conversation,
the Marchioness took Rougon's hand and held it
for a moment within her own. 'Then we may rely upon you,
dear Monsieur Rougon?' she said. 'We came from Plassans
especially for this purpose. We were beginning to feel a little
impatient. At our age you can't wonder at it. Now, however,
we shall go back feeling very happy. People told us
there that you could no longer do anything.'</p>

<p>Rougon smiled. And with an air of decision that seemed
prompted by some secret thoughts of his own, he replied:
'Where there's a will there's a way; rely on me.'</p>

<p>When they had left him, however, a shadow of regret
passed over his face. He was still tarrying in the ante-room,
when he espied a neatly-dressed man, who, balancing a small
round felt hat between his fingers, stood in a respectful attitude
in a corner.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' Rougon curtly asked him.</p>

<p>The man, who was very tall and broad-shouldered, lowered
his eyes and replied: 'Don't you recognise me, sir?' And as
Rougon declared that he did not, the other continued, 'I'm
Merle, your old usher at the Council of State.'</p>

<p>At this Rougon became somewhat softer: 'Oh, yes! But
you are wearing a full beard now. Well, my man, what do
you want me to do for you?'</p>

<p>Then Merle proceeded to explain matters in studiously
polite language. He had met Madame Correur in the afternoon,
and she had advised him to see Monsieur Rougon that
very evening. If it had not been for that, he, Merle, would
never have presumed to disturb him at such an hour.
'Madame Correur is extremely kind,' he repeated several
times. Then he went on to say that he was out of employment.
If he now wore a full beard it was because he had
left the Council of State some six months previously. When
Rougon inquired the reason of his dismissal, he would not
allow that he had been discharged for bad conduct, but bit
his lip and said: 'They all knew there how devoted I was to
you, sir. After you went away, I had to put up with all sorts
of unpleasantness, because I have never been able to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
my real feelings. One day I almost struck a fellow-servant
who was saying provoking things, and then they discharged
me.'</p>

<p>Rougon looked at him searchingly. 'And so, my man, it's
on my account that you are now out of place?'</p>

<p>Merle smiled slightly.</p>

<p>'And I owe you another berth, eh? You want me to find
you a situation somewhere?'</p>

<p>'It would be very kind of you, sir.'</p>

<p>There was a short pause. Rougon tapped his hands
together in a fidgety, mechanical way. But soon he began to
smile, having made up his mind. He had too many debts;
he must pay them and get rid of them.</p>

<p>'Well, I will look after you,' he said, 'and get you a place
somewhere. You did right to come to me, my man.'</p>

<p>Then he dismissed him. He now hesitated no longer.
He went straight into the dining-room where Gilquin had just
finished off a pot of jam, after eating a slice of <i>pâté</i>, the leg
of a fowl, and some cold potatoes. Du Poizat, who had
joined him, was sitting astride a chair and talking to him.
They were discussing women in somewhat crude language.
Gilquin had kept his hat on his head, and leant back,
lounging in his chair and picking his teeth, under the impression
that he was behaving in proper aristocratic style.</p>

<p>'Well, I must be off now,' he said, after gulping down the
contents of his glass, which was full, and smacking his lips.
'I am going to the Rue Montmartre to see what has become
of my birds.'</p>

<p>Rougon, who seemed in high spirits, began, however, to
joke at him. Now that he had dined, did he still believe in
that story of a plot? Du Poizat, too, affected complete
incredulity. He made an appointment for the next morning
with Gilquin, to whom, he said, he owed a breakfast. Gilquin,
with his cane under his arm, asked as soon as he could get
a word in: 'Then you are not going to warn——'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am, of course,' Rougon replied. 'But they'll
merely laugh at me. In any case there's no hurry. There
will be plenty of time to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p>The ex-commercial traveller had already got his hand upon
the handle of the door. However, he stepped back with a
grin on his face. 'For all I care,' he said, 'they may blow
Badinguet to smithereens.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' replied the great man, with an air of almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
religious conviction, 'the Emperor has no cause for fear, even
if your story is correct. These plots never succeed. There
is a watchful Providence.'</p>

<p>That was the last word spoken on the matter. Du Poizat
went off with Gilquin, chatting with him familiarly. An
hour later, at half-past ten, when Rougon shook hands with
M. Bouchard and the colonel as they took their leave, he
stretched his arms and yawned, saying, as was often his wont:
'I am quite tired out. I shall sleep well to-night.'</p>

<p>On the following evening three bombs exploded beneath
the Emperor's carriage in front of the Opera-house. A wild
panic seized the serried crowd blocking up the Rue Le Peletier.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
More than fifty people were struck. A woman in a blue silk
dress was killed on the spot and stretched stark in the gutter.
Two soldiers lay dying on the road. An aide-de-camp,
wounded in the neck, left drops of blood behind him. But,
under the crude glare of the gas, amidst the wreathing smoke,
the Emperor descended unhurt from his riddled carriage, and
saluted the throng. Only his hat was torn by a splinter from
one of the bombs.</p>

<p>Rougon had spent the day at home. In the morning he
had certainly felt a little restless, and had twice been on the
point of going out. However, just as he was finishing
<i>déjeuner</i>, Clorinde made her appearance; and then, in her
society, in his study, where they remained till evening, he
forgot everything. She had come to consult him on a matter
of great intricacy, and appeared extremely discouraged. She
could succeed in nothing, she said. But Rougon began to
console her, seemingly much touched by her sadness. He gave
her to understand that there was great reason for hope, and
that things would altogether change. He was by no means
ignorant of the devotion of his friends, and of all that they had
done for him, and would make it his care to reward them,
even the humblest of them. When Clorinde left him, he
kissed her on the forehead. Then after dinner he had an
irresistible longing for a walk. He left the house and took
the shortest way to the quays, feeling suffocated and craving
for the fresh breezes of the river. It was a mild winter
evening, and the low, cloudy sky hung over the city in silent
blackness. In the distance the rumbling traffic of the main
streets could be faintly heard. Rougon walked along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
deserted footways with a regular step, brushing the stone
parapet with his overcoat. The lights which spread out in
the far distance, twinkling through the darkness like stars
that marked the boundaries of some dead heaven, brought him
a sensation of the spreading magnitude of all those squares
and streets, whose houses were now quite invisible. As he
walked along Paris seemed to grow bigger, to expand more
in harmony with his own huge form, and to be capable of
giving him all the air he needed to inflate his lungs. From
the inky river, flecked here and there with shimmering gold,
there rose a gentle yet mighty breathing, like that of a sleeping
giant—fit accompaniment to his colossal dream. Then as he
came in front of the Palais de Justice, a clock struck the hour
of nine. There was a tremulous throbbing in the air, and he
turned to listen. Over the house-tops he fancied he could hear
the sounds of a sudden panic, distant reports like those of
explosions, and cries of terror. He suddenly pictured Paris
in all the stupor born of some great crime. Then he called
to mind that afternoon in June, that bright triumphant afternoon
of the Baptism, when the bells had pealed out in the hot
sunshine, and the quays had been filled with a serried multitude,
when everything had told of the glory of the Empire at
its apogee, that glory beneath which he had for a moment felt
crushed and almost jealous of the Emperor. Now he seemed
to be having his revenge. The sky was black and moonless;
the city was terror-stricken and dumb; the quays were deserted
and swept by a shudder which seemed to scare the very gas-lights,
as though some weird evil lay in ambush, yonder, in
the darkness of the night. Rougon drew in long breaths of
air, and felt that he loved that cut-throat Paris, in whose
terror-striking gloom he was regaining supreme power.</p>

<p>Ten days later, he became Minister of the Interior, in the
place of M. de Marsy, who was called to the Presidency of the
Corps Législatif.</p>



<hr class="chap">
<h3><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a></h3>

<h3>IN OFFICE</h3>


<p>One morning in March, Rougon sat in his room at the
Ministry of the Interior, drawing up a confidential circular
which was to be received by the prefects on the following day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
He kept stopping, and puffing, and dashing his pen into the
paper. 'Jules, give me a synonym for authority,' he said.
'This language of ours is horrid. I keep putting authority in
every line.'</p>

<p>'Well, there's power, government, empire,' the young man
answered with a smile.</p>

<p>M. Jules d'Escorailles, whom Rougon had appointed his
secretary, was opening the ministerial correspondence at a
corner of the writing-table. He carefully cut the envelopes
with a penknife, glanced over the letters and then classified
them. Meantime, the colonel, M. Kahn and M. Béjuin sat in
front of the grate where a large fire was burning. They were
all three reclining in their chairs and toasting their feet in
silence. M. Kahn read a newspaper, but the two others
placidly twiddled their thumbs and looked at the flames.</p>

<p>All at once Rougon rose from his chair, poured out a
glassful of water at a side table, and gulped it down at a
draught. 'I don't know what I can have eaten yesterday,' he
said, 'but I feel as though I could drink the Seine dry this
morning.'</p>

<p>He did not immediately resume his seat, but began to pace
the room and stretch his burly frame. His heavy step shook
the parqueterie underneath the thick carpet. He drew back
the green velvet window curtains to let in more light, and then,
coming back to the middle of the room, which displayed the
gloomy, faded magnificence of some palace turned into a
lodging-house, he remained there with his hands clasped
behind his neck, revelling, as it were, in the official perfume,
the odour of power which he inhaled there. He even broke
into an involuntary laugh, which grew louder and louder as it
pealed forth his sense of triumph. The colonel and the others
turned upon hearing this outburst of gaiety, and questioned
him with their eyes.</p>

<p>'Ah! it's very nice, all the same,' were the only words he
would say.</p>

<p>However, as he sat down again at the huge rosewood
writing-table, Merle came into the room. The usher was
irreproachably dressed in black, with a white tie. Not a hair
remained upon his dignified face. He was again clean-shaven.</p>

<p>'I beg your excellency's pardon,' he said, 'but the prefect
of the Somme——'</p>

<p>'Tell him to go to the deuce! I'm busy,' Rougon answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
roughly. 'It's quite preposterous that I am never to be
allowed a moment to myself.'</p>

<p>Merle seemed in no way disconcerted, however. 'The
prefect,' he resumed, 'says that your excellency is expecting
him. There are also the prefects of the Nièvre, the Cher, and
the Jura.'</p>

<p>'Well, let them wait! That's what they're made for,'
rejoined Rougon loudly.</p>

<p>The usher left the room. M. d'Escorailles had broken
into a smile; while the others who were warming themselves
at the fire lolled back more freely than ever in their chairs,
and seemed amused by the minister's reply. He was flattered
by his success.</p>

<p>'It is true,' he said, 'that I have been going through the
prefects for the last month. It was necessary that I should
have them all here. A nice lot they are, too; some rare
stupids amongst them. However, they are very obedient.
But I feel that I have had enough of them. And, besides, it's
for their benefit that I'm working this morning.'</p>

<p>Then he turned to his circular again. The warm silence
of the room was only broken by the scratching of his quill-pen
and the slight rustling of the envelopes which M. d'Escorailles
opened. M. Kahn had taken up another newspaper, and
the colonel and M. Béjuin were half asleep.</p>

<p>Outside, France was hushed in fear. The Emperor, in
summoning Rougon to power, had been desirous of making
examples. He knew the great man's iron hand, and had said
to him on the morning after the attempt on his life, with all
the anger of one who has just escaped assassination, 'No
moderation, mind! They must be made to fear you.' He had
just armed him, too, with that terrible Law of General Safety,
which authorised the confinement in Algeria or the expulsion
from the empire of anyone who might be convicted of a political
offence. Although no single Frenchman had taken part
in the crime of the Rue Le Peletier, the Republicans were
about to be hunted down and transported; there was to be a
general sweeping away of the ten thousand 'suspects' who
had been passed over at the time of the <i>coup d'état</i>. There
were rumours of contemplated action by the revolutionary
party. The authorities were said to have made a seizure of
weapons and treasonable documents. Already in the middle
of March, three hundred and eighty persons had been shipped
at Toulon for Algeria, and now every week a fresh contingent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
was sent off. The whole country trembled in the terror
which like a black storm-cloud rolled forth from the room
with the green velvet curtains where Rougon laughed aloud
while stretching his arms.</p>

<p>The great man had never before tasted such complete
contentment. He felt well and strong, and was putting on
flesh. Health had come back to him with his return to
power. When he walked about the room he dug his heels
into the carpet, as though he wanted his heavy tread to
resound throughout France. He would have liked to shake
the country by merely putting his empty glass down on the
side-table or casting aside his pen. It delighted him to be a
source of fear, to forge thunderbolts amidst the smiling gratification
of his friends, and to crush a whole nation with his
swollen parvenu fists. In one of his circulars he had written:
'It is for the good to feel confidence, and for the wicked only
to tremble.' He revelled in playing this part of a divinity,
damning some, and saving others. He was filled with mighty
pride; his idolatry of his own strength and intelligence was
becoming a real religion with him.</p>

<p>Among the new men who had sprung up with the Second
Empire, Rougon had long been known as a partisan of strong
government. His name was a synonym for stern repression,
the refusal of all liberties; despotic rule, in fact. All knew
therefore what they had to expect when they saw him called
to office. To his intimate friends, however, Rougon unbosomed
himself. He did not, he said, so much hold opinions
as feel a craving for power. Power had too much attraction
for him, and was too essential to his appetite for him to refuse
it, whatever the conditions on which it might be offered to
him.</p>

<p>To rule, to set his foot on the neck of the crowd, was his
first and immediate ambition; the rest was merely secondary
matter to which he could easily accommodate himself. The
one thing which he really wanted was to be chief. It so happened,
however, that the circumstances under which he was
now returning to power made his success very pleasant. The
Emperor had given him complete liberty of action, and he was
at last in a position to realise his old dream of driving the
multitude with a whip like a herd of cattle. Nothing filled
him with greater satisfaction than to know that he was feared
and disliked. And sometimes when his friends told him that
he was a tyrant, he smiled, and said with deep meaning: 'If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
I should become a liberal some day, people will say that I
have changed.'</p>

<p>Rougon's very greatest joy was to stand triumphant amidst
those friends of his. He forgot France and the obsequious
functionaries and the crowd of petitioners who besieged his
doors, to regale himself with the perpetual admiration of his
ten or twelve intimate associates. His office was open to
them at any hour, he allowed them to make it a home, to
take possession of his chairs, and even of his desk itself; he
told them that it was a pleasure to have them always about
him like a pack of faithful dogs. It was not he alone, but the
whole coterie, that was the minister. The bonds between
them seemed to be drawn closer now that success had come,
and Rougon began to love his followers with a jealous love,
keeping them in constant communion with him, feeling as if
his greatness were increased by their several ambitions. He
forgot his secret contempt for them, and began to consider
them very intelligent and able, similar to himself. He particularly
desired, moreover, that he himself should be respected
in their persons, and defended them passionately as he might
have defended the fingers of his hands. He made their
quarrels his own, and, smiling at the recollection of their
long endeavours on his behalf, he even ended by believing that
he was greatly indebted to them. Desiring nothing for himself,
he lavished upon them all the fruits of office, indulging
to repletion in the pleasure of enhancing the brilliancy of his
fortune by thus scattering the gifts at his disposal.</p>

<p>However, the big warm room remained silent for some
time. Then M. d'Escorailles, after glancing at the address
on one of the envelopes before him, handed it to Rougon
without opening it. 'Here is a letter from my father,' he
said.</p>

<p>Writing in a strain of excessive humility, the Marquis
thanked the minister for having appointed Jules to be his
secretary. There were two pages of fine writing which
Rougon carefully read. Then he folded the letter and slipped
it into his pocket. And before turning to his work again he
asked: 'Hasn't Du Poizat written?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' answered the secretary, picking a letter out from
among the others. 'He is beginning to find his way about in
his prefecture. He says that Deux-Sèvres, and the town of
Niort in particular, want guiding with a firm hand.'</p>

<p>Rougon glanced over the letter, and remarked: 'Certainly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
he shall have all the authority he requires. There is no
occasion to send him any reply. My circular will be
sufficient.'</p>

<p>Then he took up his pen again, and cudgelled his brains
for some suitable concluding sentences. Du Poizat had particularly
wished to be prefect at Niort, in his own native
district, and the minister, when taking any important decision,
invariably thought of the department of Deux-Sèvres, and
governed France in accordance with the opinions and necessities
of his old comrade in poverty. Just as he was at last
finishing his circular to the prefects, something seemed to
irritate M. Kahn.</p>

<p>'It is abominable!' the latter exclaimed; and, rapping
the newspaper he was reading, he turned to Rougon, and
cried: 'Have you read this? There is a leading article here
appealing to the basest passions. Just listen to this: "The
hand that punishes should be impeccable, for, if justice miscarries,
the very bonds which unite society loosen of their own
accord." You understand the insinuation, eh? And, here
again, among the miscellaneous paragraphs, there's a story
about a Countess eloping with the son of a corn-factor. The
papers ought not to be allowed to publish such things. It
tends to destroy the people's respect for the upper classes.'</p>

<p>'But the serial story is still more odious,' interposed
M. d'Escorailles. 'It's all about a wife, a woman of good
breeding, who betrays her husband. And the author does
not even make her feel any remorse.'</p>

<p>Rougon made an angry gesture. 'Yes,' he said, 'my
attention has already been called to that number. You will
see that I have marked certain passages with a red pencil.
And it is one of our own papers, too! Every day I am obliged
to go over it line by line. Ah! the best of them are bad; we
ought to suppress them all!' Then, compressing his lips, he
added, in a lower tone: 'I have sent for the editor, and am
expecting him here presently.'</p>

<p>The colonel had taken the paper from M. Kahn. He also
soon vented expressions of indignation, and then handed the
print to M. Béjuin, who likewise showed his disgust
Rougon, in the meanwhile, was resting his elbows on his
table and reflecting, with eyes half-closed.</p>

<p>'By the way,' he said, turning to his secretary, 'that poor
Huguenin died yesterday. That leaves an inspectorship
vacant. We shall have to appoint somebody to it.' Then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the three friends sitting before the fire briskly raised their
heads, he continued: 'Oh, it's a post of no importance. Six
thousand francs a year. But it's true that there's absolutely
nothing to do——'</p>

<p>However, he was interrupted by a person opening the door
of an adjoining room.</p>

<p>'Oh, come in, Monsieur Bouchard, come in!' he cried,
'I was just going to call for you.'</p>

<p>Bouchard, who had been appointed head of department a
week previously, had brought with him a memorandum about the
mayors and prefects who had asked for the crosses of chevalier
and officer in the Legion of Honour. Rougon had twenty-five
crosses to dispose of among the most meritorious of the applicants.
He took the memorandum, read over the names and
consulted various papers, while M. Bouchard went up to the
fire and shook hands with the three others. Then, with his
back against the mantelpiece, and his coat-tails raised in order
that he might warm his legs, the chief of department said:
'A miserably wet day, isn't it? We shall have a late
spring.'</p>

<p>'It's awful,' replied the colonel, 'I feel one of my attacks
coming on. I had shooting pains in my left foot all night.'</p>

<p>'And how is your wife?' asked M. Kahn after a short
pause.</p>

<p>'Thank you, she is very well,' replied M. Bouchard.
'I am expecting to see her here this morning.'</p>

<p>Then there was another pause. Rougon was still examining
the papers. As he came to a certain name, he stopped.
'Isidore Gaudibert—that isn't the man who writes verses,
is it?'</p>

<p>'Yes, that is the man,' M. Bouchard answered. 'He has
been Mayor of Barbeville since 1852. On every happy event,
the Emperor's marriage, the Empress's confinement, and the
Prince Imperial's baptism, he has sent charming verses to
their Majesties.'</p>

<p>The minister pouted scornfully. The colonel, however,
asserted that he had read the odes and thought them very
fine. He referred to one in particular, in which the Emperor
was compared to a piece of fireworks. Then without any
transition the friends began to eulogise the Emperor. They
were all enthusiastic Bonapartists now. The two cousins, the
colonel and M. Bouchard, were completely reconciled, and,
instead of throwing the Orleans Princes and the Count de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Chambord at each other's head, rivalled in singing their
sovereign's praise.</p>

<p>'Oh, no! not this one!' Rougon suddenly exclaimed.
'This Jusselin is a creature of Marsy's. There is no call for
me to reward the friends of my predecessor.' Then with
a stroke of his pen, that cut through the paper, he effaced the
name. 'But we must find some one,' he resumed. 'It is an
officer's cross.'</p>

<p>The friends sat perfectly still. M. d'Escorailles, notwithstanding
his extreme youth, had received the chevalier's cross
a week previously. M. Kahn and M. Bouchard were already
officers, and the colonel had just been named commander.</p>

<p>'Well, let us see: an officer's cross,' said Rougon,
beginning to refer to his papers again. But he stopped short
as if struck by a sudden idea. 'Aren't you mayor of some
place or other, Monsieur Béjuin?' he inquired.</p>

<p>M. Béjuin contented himself with nodding twice, but
M. Kahn answered more fully for him. 'Yes,' said he; 'he
is Mayor of Saint Florent, the little commune where his glass
works are.'</p>

<p>'Well, then, that's settled!' said the minister, delighted to
have an opportunity of advancing one of his friends. 'You
never ask for anything for yourself, Monsieur Béjuin, so I
must look after you.'</p>

<p>M. Béjuin smiled and expressed his thanks. It was quite
true that he never asked for anything, but he was always
there, silent and modest, on the look-out for such crumbs
as might fall, and ready to pick them up.</p>

<p>'Léon Béjuin—isn't it?—in the place of Pierre François
Jusselin,' continued Rougon, as he altered the names.</p>

<p>'Béjuin, Jusselin; they rhyme,' observed the Colonel.</p>

<p>This remark struck the company as being very witty, and
caused a deal of laughter. At last M. Bouchard took the
signed documents away, and Rougon rose. His legs were
paining him a little, he said. The wet weather affected him.</p>

<p>However, the morning was wearing on; a hum of life
came from the various offices; quick steps resounded in the
neighbouring rooms; doors were opened and closed, and
whispers half-stifled by the velvet hangings were wafted hither
and thither. Several clerks came into the room to obtain the
minister's signature to other documents. It was a continual
coming and going, the administrative machine was in full
work, throwing out an enormous number of documents which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
were carried from office to office. And amidst all this hurrying
to and fro, a score of people were wearily waiting in the ante-room
till his excellency should be graciously pleased to receive
them. Rougon, meantime, began to display feverish activity
and energy; giving orders in a whisper in one corner of his
room, then suddenly storming at some official in another,
allotting some task, or deciding a knotty question with a word,
while he stood there, huge and domineering, his neck swollen,
and his face a picture of strength.</p>

<p>However, Merle came into the room again with that quiet
composure which no rebuffs could ruffle. 'The prefect of the
Somme——' he began.</p>

<p>'Again!' interrupted Rougon violently.</p>

<p>The usher bowed and then resumed, 'The prefect of the
Somme has begged me to ask your excellency if you can receive
him this morning. If your excellency cannot, then he would
be much obliged to your excellency if you would kindly fix
a time for to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'I will see him this morning. Confound it all, let him
have a little patience!'</p>

<p>Merle had left the door open, and the ante-room could be
seen. It was a spacious apartment, with a large table in the
centre and a line of arm-chairs, covered with red velvet, along
the walls. All the chairs were occupied, and there were even
two ladies standing by the table. Every face was turned
towards the minister's room, with a wistful, supplicating
expression, as if seeking permission to enter. Near the door,
the prefect of the Somme, a pale little man, was talking with
his colleagues from the Jura and the Cher. He was on the
point of rising, in the expectation that he was at last about to
be received in audience, when Rougon again spoke. 'In ten
minutes,' he said to Merle. 'Just at present I cannot see
anyone.'</p>

<p>While he was speaking, however, he caught sight of
M. Beulin-d'Orchère crossing the ante-chamber, and thereupon
he darted forward, and drew him by the hand into his private
room.</p>

<p>'Come in, my friend, come in!' he exclaimed. 'You
have just come, haven't you? You haven't been waiting?
Well, what news have you brought?'</p>

<p>Then Merle closed the door, and the occupants of the ante-chamber
were left in silence and consternation. Rougon and
M. Beulin-d'Orchère talked together in whispers near one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the windows. The judge, who had recently been appointed
first president of the Court of Paris, was ambitious of holding
the Seals; but the Emperor, when sounded on the matter,
had shown himself quite impenetrable.</p>

<p>'Very good, very good,' said Rougon, suddenly raising his
voice. 'Your information is excellent. I will take steps, I
promise you.'</p>

<p>He was just showing the judge out by way of his private
room, when Merle appeared once more. 'Monsieur La Rouquette,'
he announced this time.</p>

<p>'No, no! I am busy, and he bores me,' said Rougon,
signing energetically to the usher to close the door.</p>

<p>M. La Rouquette distinctly heard what was said; still,
this did not prevent him from entering the minister's room
with a smiling face. 'How is your excellency?' he said,
offering his hand. 'It's my sister who has sent me. You
seemed a little tired at the Tuileries yesterday. You know
that a proverb is to be acted in the Empress's apartments
next Monday. My sister is taking a part in it. Combelot
has designed the costumes. You will come, won't you?'</p>

<p>He stood there for a whole quarter of an hour prattling
away in wheedling fashion, addressing Rougon sometimes as
'your excellency,' and sometimes as 'dear master.' He
dragged in a few stories of the minor theatres, praised a ballet
girl, and begged for a line to the director of the tobacco
manufactory so that he might get some good cigars. And he
concluded by saying some abominable things about M. de
Marsy, though still continuing to jest.</p>

<p>'Well, he's not such a bad fellow, after all,' remarked
Rougon, when the young deputy had taken himself off. 'I
must go and dip my face in the basin. My cheeks feel as if
they were burning.'</p>

<p>He disappeared for a moment behind a curtain, and then
a great splashing of water, accompanied by snorting and
blowing, was heard. Meantime, M. d'Escorailles, who had
finished classifying his letters, took a little file with a tortoise-shell
handle from his pocket, and began to trim his nails.
M. Béjuin and the colonel were still gazing up at the ceiling, so
buried in their easy-chairs that it seemed doubtful whether
they would ever be able to get out of them again. M. Kahn,
however, was going through a heap of newspapers on a table
near him. He just turned them over, glanced at their titles,
and then threw them aside. Then he got up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>'Are you going?' asked Rougon, who now reappeared,
wiping his face with a towel.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied M. Kahn, 'I've read the papers, so I'm off.'</p>

<p>Rougon, however, asked him to wait a moment. And
then, taking him aside, he told him that he hoped to go down
to Deux-Sèvres during the following week, to attend the
inauguration of the operations for the new line from Niort to
Angers. He had several reasons, he said, for wishing to visit
the district. At this M. Kahn manifested great delight. He
had succeeded in getting the grant early in March, and was
now floating the scheme. And he was conscious of the additional
importance which the minister's presence would lend to
the initial ceremony, the details of which he was already
arranging.</p>

<p>'Then I may reckon upon you to fire the first mine?' he
said, as he took his leave.</p>

<p>Rougon had returned to his writing-table, where he was
consulting a list of names. The crowd in the ante-room was
now growing more and more impatient. 'I've barely got a
quarter of an hour,' he said. 'Well, I'll see such as I can.'</p>

<p>Then he rang his bell, and, when Merle appeared, he said
to him: 'Show in the prefect of the Somme.' But he immediately
added, still keeping his eyes on the list of names:
'Wait a moment. Are Monsieur and Madame Charbonnel
there? Show them in.'</p>

<p>The usher's voice could be heard calling out, 'Monsieur
and Madame Charbonnel.' And thereupon the couple from
Plassans appeared, followed by the astonished eyes of the
other occupants of the ante-chamber. M. Charbonnel wore a
dress-coat with square tails and a velvet collar, and Madame
Charbonnel was dressed in puce silk, with a bonnet trimmed
with yellow ribbons. They had been patiently waiting for
two hours.</p>

<p>'You ought to have sent your card in to me,' said Rougon.
'Merle knows you.' Then, interrupting their stammering
greeting, in which the words 'your excellency' again and
again recurred, he gaily exclaimed: 'Victory! The Council
of State has given judgment. We have beaten that terrible
bishop!'</p>

<p>The old lady's emotion upon hearing this was so great
that she was obliged to sit down, while her husband leant for
support against an arm-chair.</p>

<p>'I learned this good news yesterday evening,' the minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
continued. 'And as I was anxious to tell it to you, myself,
I asked you to come here. It's a pretty little windfall, five
hundred thousand francs, eh?'</p>

<p>He began to jest, feeling quite happy at the sight of the
emotion on their faces. Some time elapsed before Madame
Charbonnel, in a choking timorous voice, could ask: 'Is it
really all over, then? Really? Can't they start the suit
again?'</p>

<p>'No, no; be quite easy about it,' answered Rougon. 'The
fortune is yours.'</p>

<p>Then he gave them certain particulars. The Council of
State had refused to allow the Sisters of the Holy Family to
take possession of the bequest upon the ground that natural
heirs were living, and that the will did not present the necessary
appearances of genuineness. Monseigneur Rochart was
in a terrible rage, said Rougon; he had met the bishop the
previous day at the Ministry of Public Instruction, and still
laughed at the recollection of his angry looks. He seemed,
indeed, quite delighted with his triumph over the prelate.</p>

<p>'His Grace hasn't been able to gobble me up, you see,' he
continued; 'I am too big a mouthful for him. I don't think,
though, that it's all over between us. I could see that by the
look of his eyes. He is a man who never forgets anything, I
should imagine. However, the rest will be my own business.'</p>

<p>The Charbonnels were profuse in their expressions of
gratitude and respect. They should leave Paris that same
evening, they said; for all at once great anxiety had come
upon them. Their cousin Chevassu's house, at Faverolles,
had been left in the charge of a bigoted old woman who was
extremely devoted to the Sisters of the Holy Family, and on
learning the issue of the trial she might perhaps strip the
house of its contents and go off with them. The Sisters, said
the Charbonnels, were capable of anything.</p>

<p>'Yes, get off this evening,' the minister advised. 'If anything
should happen to bother you down there, just write and
let me know about it.'</p>

<p>Then on opening the door to show them out, he noticed
the marked astonishment of the occupants of the ante-chamber.
The prefect of the Somme was exchanging a smile
with his colleagues of the Jura and the Cher, while an expression
of scorn wreathed the lips of the two ladies standing
by the table. And thereupon Rougon raised his voice, saying:
'You will write to me, won't you? You know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
devoted I am to you. When you get to Plassans tell my
mother that I am in good health.'</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he crossed the ante-chamber with them,
accompanying them to the outer door so as to exalt them
before all the waiting people, feeling in no wise ashamed of
them, but proud, rather, of having come himself from their
little town, and of now being able to raise them as high as he
pleased. And the favour-seekers and the functionaries bowed
low, doing reverence, as it were, to the puce silk gown and
square-tailed coat of the Charbonnels.</p>

<p>When Rougon returned to his own room, he found that
the colonel had risen from his chair.</p>

<p>'Good-bye till this evening,' said Jobelin. 'It's getting
rather too warm in here.'</p>

<p>Then he bent forward to whisper a few words concerning
his son Auguste, whom he was about to remove from college,
as he quite despaired of the young fellow ever passing his
examination. Rougon had promised to take him into his
office, although according to the regulations all the clerks
ought to hold a bachelor's degree.</p>

<p>'Very well, bring him here,' said the minister. 'I will
have the regulation relaxed; I will manage it somehow.
And he shall have a salary at once, as you are anxious
about it.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the colonel went off, and M. Béjuin remained
alone in front of the fire. He wheeled his chair into a
central position, and seemed quite unaware that the room
was growing empty. He always remained in this fashion
till every one else had gone, in the hope of being offered
something which had been hitherto forgotten.</p>

<p>Merle now received orders to introduce the prefect of the
Somme. Instead of going to the door, however, he stepped
up to the writing-table. 'If your excellency will kindly
permit me,' he said, with a pleasant smile, 'I will at once
acquit myself of a little commission.'</p>

<p>Rougon rested his elbows on his blotting-pad and listened.</p>

<p>'It is about poor Madame Correur,' continued Merle. 'I
went to see her this morning. She was in bed. She has got
a nasty boil in a very awkward place; such a big one too;
and although there is nothing dangerous about it, it gives
her a great deal of pain.'</p>

<p>'Well?' said the minister.</p>

<p>'Well, the poor lady very much wanted to come and see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
your excellency to get the answers you had promised her.
Just as I was coming away, she asked me if I would bring
her them after my day's work. Would your excellency be
so good as to let me do so?'</p>

<p>The minister quietly turned and said: 'Monsieur
d'Escorailles, give me those papers there, in that cupboard.'</p>

<p>It was to a collection of documents concerning Madame
Correur that he referred. They were tightly packed in a
large case of stout grey paper. There were letters, and plans,
and petitions, in all kinds of writing and spelling; requests
for tobacco-agencies, for licenses to sell stamps, petitions for
pecuniary assistance, grants and pensions. Each sheet bore
a marginal note of five or six lines, followed by Madame
Correur's big masculine-looking signature.</p>

<p>Rougon turned the papers over and glanced at some
brief memoranda which he himself had written on them with
a red pencil: 'Madame Jalaguier's pension is raised to
eighteen hundred francs,' he said. 'A tobacco-agency is
granted to Madame Leturc. Madame Chardon's tender is
accepted. Nothing has yet been done in Madame Testanière's
matter. Ah! you can say, too, that I have been successful
in Mademoiselle Herminie Billecoq's case. I have mentioned
it to some ladies who will provide the dowry necessary for
her marriage with the officer who seduced her.'</p>

<p>'I thank your excellency a thousand times,' said Merle,
with a low bow.</p>

<p>As he was going out, a charming blonde head, surmounted
by a pink bonnet, peeped in at the door, and a fluty voice
inquired: 'Can I come in?'</p>

<p>Then, without waiting for a reply, Madame Bouchard
entered the room. She had not seen the usher in the ante-chamber,
so she had come straight on. Rougon, who
addressed her as 'my dear child,' asked her to sit down, after
momentarily detaining her little gloved hands within his
own. 'Have you come about anything important?' he
asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, very important,' answered Madame Bouchard with
a smile.</p>

<p>Rougon thereupon told Merle to admit nobody. M.
d'Escorailles, who had just finished trimming his nails, had
advanced to greet Madame Bouchard. She signed to him to
stoop, and immediately whispered a few words to him. He
nodded assent, and then, taking his hat, turned to Rougon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
saying: 'I'm going to breakfast. There doesn't seem to
be anything else of importance excepting that matter of the
inspectorship. We shall have to give it to someone.'</p>

<p>The minister looked perplexed. 'Yes, certainly,' he said,
'we shall have to appoint somebody. A whole heap of men
have already been suggested to me; but I don't care to
appoint people whom I don't know.'</p>

<p>Then he glanced round the room as though trying to find
somebody, and his eye fell upon M. Béjuin, still silently
lounging before the fire, with an expression of complete
unconcern upon his face.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Béjuin,' said Rougon.</p>

<p>M. Béjuin opened his eyes, but remained quite still.</p>

<p>'Would you like to be an inspector?' added the minister.
'I may tell you that it's a post worth six thousand francs a
year. There is nothing to do, and the place is quite compatible
with your position as a deputy.'</p>

<p>M. Béjuin nodded gently. Yes, yes, he would accept the
post. And so the matter was settled. However, he still
lingered before the fire for a few more minutes, when it
probably struck him that there was no likelihood of his picking
up any more crumbs that morning, for with a dragging
step he took himself off in the rear of M. d'Escorailles.</p>

<p>'There! we are alone now! Come, my dear child, what's
the matter?' said Rougon to pretty Madame Bouchard.</p>

<p>He wheeled up an easy-chair and sat down in front of
her in the centre of the room. And then for the first time
he noticed her dress. It was of very soft pale rose cashmere,
and hung round her in close, clinging folds. There seemed,
also, to be something very bewitching about her appearance
that morning.</p>

<p>'Well, what's the matter?' repeated Rougon.</p>

<p>Madame Bouchard smiled without making any immediate
answer. She sat back in her chair, with parted lips showing
her pearly white teeth. Little curls peeped from under her
pink bonnet, and there was a coaxing expression on her little
face, an air of mingled supplication and submission.</p>

<p>'It is something I want to ask of you,' she murmured at
last; and then, in an animated way, she added: 'Promise me
that you'll do it.'</p>

<p>But Rougon would promise nothing. He wanted to know
what it was first. He mistrusted ladies. And as she bent
towards him, he said to her: 'Is it something very unusual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
that you daren't tell me? Well, I must get it out of you by
questions. Let us set about it methodically. Is it something
for your husband?'</p>

<p>But Madame Bouchard shook her head, while still continuing
to smile.</p>

<p>'No! Is it for Monsieur d'Escorailles, then? You were
plotting something together in whispers a little while ago.'</p>

<p>But Madame Bouchard again shook her head; and pulled
a pretty little face which clearly signified that it had been
necessary for her to get rid of M. d'Escorailles. Then, as
Rougon was wondering what it could be that she wanted, she
drew her chair still nearer to him. 'You won't scold me, will
you?' she said. 'You do like me a little, don't you? Well,
it's for a young man. You don't know him, but I'll tell you
his name directly, when you have promised to give him the
post. Oh, it's quite an insignificant one that I want for him.
You will only have to say a word and we shall be very, very
grateful to you.'</p>

<p>'Is he a relation of yours?' Rougon inquired.</p>

<p>Madame Bouchard sighed deeply, glanced at him with
languishing eyes, and then let her hands slip down so that
Rougon might take them in his own. And finally in a very
low voice, she replied: 'No, he's a friend of mine—a particular
friend—Oh! I am very unhappy!'</p>

<p>Her eyes added all that she left unsaid.</p>

<p>'But this is very shocking!' exclaimed the minister, and
then, as she still leant towards him, raising her little gloved
hand to his lips to silence him, he roughly repulsed her, compelling
her to rise to her feet. She remained before him with
pale lips and downcast eyes. 'Yes, it is disgraceful! abominable!'
he continued. 'Monsieur Bouchard is an excellent
man. He worships you. He trusts you with blind confidence.
No, no, indeed! I will certainly not help you to deceive him.
I refuse, refuse absolutely, do you hear? It is of no use
mincing words with you, my pretty young woman!'</p>

<p>Then he checked himself, and, gradually becoming calmer,
assumed an air of great dignity. Seeing that Madame
Bouchard had begun to tremble, he made her sit down again
while he himself remained erect, lecturing her severely. It
was a real sermon that he preached to her. He told her that
she was offending against all laws, both human and divine;
that she was standing on the brink of a precipice, and preparing
for herself an old age full of remorse. Then, fancying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
that he could detect a faint smile hovering round the corners
of her lips, he proceeded to draw a picture of the old age he
predicted, when her beauty would be in ruins, her heart for ever
empty, and her brow flushed with shame beneath her white
hair. And afterwards he discussed her conduct from a social
point of view, in this respect showing much severity, and he
went on to rail at modern licentiousness, at the disgraceful
dissoluteness of the times. Then he spoke of himself. He
was the guardian of the laws, he said, and could never abuse
his power by lending himself to the encouragement of vice.
Without virtue it seemed to him that government was impossible.
Finally, he concluded by defying his enemies to name
a single act of nepotism in his administration, a single favour
granted by him that, was due to intrigue.</p>

<p>Pretty Madame Bouchard listened with downcast head,
huddling herself up in her chair and letting her delicate neck
show from under the ribbons of her pink bonnet. When
Rougon had at last finished speaking, she rose and made her
way to the door, without saying a word. But as she laid her
fingers upon the handle, she raised her head and began to
smile again. 'He is named Georges Duchesne,' she murmured.
'He is principal clerk in my husband's division, and
wants to be assistant——'</p>

<p>'No, no!' cried Rougon.</p>

<p>Then she slowly left the room, casting a long contemptuous
glance at the minister, who came back from the door with
an expression of weariness on his face. He had beckoned to
Merle to follow him. The door remained ajar.</p>

<p>'The editor of the <i>Vœu National</i>, whom your excellency
sent for, has just arrived,' said the usher in a low tone.</p>

<p>'Very good,' replied Rougon; 'but I'll see the officials
who have been waiting so long first.'</p>

<p>Just at that moment, however, a valet appeared at the
door which led to the minister's private apartments, and
announced that <i>déjeuner</i> was ready, and that Madame Delestang
was waiting for his excellency in the drawing room.</p>

<p>At this Rougon stepped forward. 'Tell them to serve
at once,' he replied briskly. 'So much the worse for the
gentlemen; I will see them afterwards. I'm frightfully
hungry.'</p>

<p>Then he just popped his head through the doorway and
gave a glance round the ante-room, which was still full. Not
a functionary or a petitioner had moved. The three prefects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
were still talking together in their corner. The two ladies
by the table were leaning upon their finger-tips, as if a little
weary. The same people sat motionless and silent in the red
velvet chairs along the walls. Then Rougon left his room,
giving Merle orders to detain the prefect of the Somme and
the editor of the <i>Vœu National</i>.</p>

<p>Madame Rougon, who was not very well, had left on the
previous evening for the South of France, where she was
going to stay for a month. She had an uncle living in the
neighbourhood of Pau. On the other hand, Delestang had
been in Italy for the last six weeks, on an important mission
connected with agriculture. And thus it came about that the
minister had invited Clorinde, who wanted to have a long talk
with him, to partake of <i>déjeuner</i> at his official residence.</p>

<p>Patiently waiting for him, she was beguiling the time by
glancing through a law-treatise which she had found upon a
table.</p>

<p>'You must be getting dreadfully hungry,' he said to her
gaily as he entered the drawing-room. 'I've had a tremendous
lot to do this morning.'</p>

<p>Then he gave her his arm and conducted her into the
dining-room, an immense apartment where the little table,
laid for two, near a window, seemed quite lost. A couple of
tall footmen waited upon them. Rougon and Clorinde, who
both preserved a very serious demeanour, ate rapidly. Their
meal consisted of a few radishes, a slice of cold salmon, some
cutlets with mashed potatoes, and a little cheese. They took
no wine—Rougon drank nothing but water of a morning—and
they scarcely exchanged a dozen words. Then, when the
two footmen had cleared the table and brought in the coffee
and liqueurs, Clorinde glanced at Rougon and gave a slight
twitch of her eyebrows which he perfectly understood.</p>

<p>'That will do; you can go now,' he said to the footmen.
'I will ring if I require anything.'</p>

<p>The servants left the room, and Clorinde, rising from her
chair, tapped her skirt to remove the crumbs which had fallen
on it. She was wearing that day a black silk dress, somewhat
too large for her and laden with flounces, a very elaborate
dress which so enveloped her figure as to make her look like a
mere bundle.</p>

<p>'What a tremendous place this is!' she remarked, going
to the end of the room. 'It's the kind of place for a wedding
feast, this dining-room of yours.' Then she came back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
said: 'I should very much like to smoke a cigarette, do you
know?'</p>

<p>'The deuce,' replied Rougon; 'there's no tobacco. I
never smoke myself.'</p>

<p>But Clorinde winked and drew from her pocket a little
tobacco pouch, of red silk, embroidered with gold, and scarcely
larger than a purse. She rolled a cigarette with the tips of
her tapering fingers, and then, as they did not wish to ring,
they began to search the room for matches. At last they
found three on a sideboard, and Clorinde carefully carried
them off. With her cigarette between her lips, she sat back
in her chair and began to sip her coffee, while gazing smilingly
at Rougon.</p>

<p>'Well, I am entirely at your service now,' he remarked,
with an answering smile. 'You want to talk to me; so let
us talk.'</p>

<p>Clorinde made a gesture as though to express that what
she had to say was of no consequence. 'Yes,' she rejoined; 'I
have had a letter from my husband. He is feeling very bored
at Turin. Of course, he is much pleased at having got this
mission, thanks to you, but he doesn't want to be forgotten
while he is away. However, we can talk of all that presently.
There's no hurry about it.'</p>

<p>Then she again began to smoke and look at Rougon with
her irritating smile. The minister had gradually accustomed
himself to seeing her, without worrying about those questions
which had formerly so disturbed him. Clorinde had now
become a feature of his daily life, and he accepted her as
though he understood her, as though her eccentricities no
longer caused him the faintest surprise. As a matter of fact,
however, he knew nothing certain about her even yet: she
was as great a mystery to him as she had been in the first
days of their acquaintance. She constantly varied, sometimes
acting childishly, sometimes showing herself very deep and
knowing; for although, as a rule, she seemed very foolish,
she occasionally manifested singular shrewdness. And now,
too, she was very gentle, and now extremely spiteful. When
she surprised Rougon by some word or gesture which he could
not understand, he shrugged his shoulders with an expression
of superiority, opining that all women behaved in that fantastic
way. He fancied that he thus manifested a supreme
contempt for the sex, but his manner merely sharpened
Clorinde's smile, a smile which had an expression of crafty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
cruelty about it, revealing as it did her eager teeth between
her ruby lips.</p>

<p>'Why are you looking at me in that way?' Rougon asked
her at length, feeling disturbed by the steady gaze of her
large eyes. 'Is there anything about me which displeases
you?'</p>

<p>Some hidden thought had just brought a gleam from the
depths of Clorinde's eyes, and her lips had assumed a hard
expression. But she quickly put on a charming smile again,
and began to puff out little whiffs of smoke while saying:
'Oh, dear no, you're very nice. I was thinking about something,
my dear fellow. Do you know that you have been
very lucky?'</p>

<p>'How's that?'</p>

<p>'Why, yes. Here you are on the pinnacle which you were
so anxious to reach. Everybody has helped to lift you to it,
and events themselves have worked for you.'</p>

<p>Rougon was about to reply when there came a knock at
the door. Clorinde instinctively hid her cigarette behind her
skirts. It was a clerk with an urgent telegram for his excellency.
Rougon read the despatch with an air of displeasure,
and after telling the clerk what reply was to be made to
it, hastily closed the door with a bang and took his seat
again.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'I have certainly had some devoted friends,
and am now trying to remember them. And you are right,
too, in saying that I owe something to events. It often
happens that men are powerless, unless they are helped by
events.'</p>

<p>As he spoke these words in slow deliberate tones he
glanced at Clorinde, lowering his heavy eyelids so as to conceal
the fact that he was trying to penetrate her meaning.
Why had she spoken of his luck? he wondered. What did
she know of the favourable events to which she had referred?
Had Du Poizat been saying anything to her? But when he
saw the smiling, dreamy look of her face, which had suddenly
softened, he felt sure that she knew nothing whatever upon
the subject. He himself, too, was trying to forget certain
things, and did not care to stir up the inner chambers of his
memory. There was an hour of his life which now seemed
hazy and confused to him, and he was beginning to believe
that he really owed his high position solely to the devotion
of his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>'I didn't want anything,' he continued; 'I was driven
into it in spite of myself. Well, I suppose things have turned
out for the best. If I succeed in doing any good, I shall be
quite satisfied.'</p>

<p>Then he finished his cup of coffee, while Clorinde rolled
another cigarette.</p>

<p>'Do you remember,' she inquired, 'my asking you, two
years ago, when you were leaving the Council of State, your
reason for your sudden whim? You were very reserved then,
but surely you can speak out now. Come, between ourselves,
tell me frankly if you had a definite plan in your mind.'</p>

<p>'One always has a plan,' he answered shrewdly. 'I felt that
I was falling, and preferred to jump down of my own accord.'</p>

<p>'And has your plan been realised? Have events happened
just as you anticipated?'</p>

<p>'Well, hardly that. Things never turn out exactly as one
calculates. One must be satisfied if one attains one's end
somehow.' Then he paused to offer Clorinde a glass of
liqueur. 'Which will you have, curaçoa or chartreuse?'
She chose chartreuse; and, as Rougon was pouring it out,
there came another knock at the door. Clorinde again hid
her cigarette with a gesture of impatience, whilst Rougon got
up angrily, still holding the decanter. This time it was a
letter bearing a large seal which was brought for his inspection.
When he had glanced at it, he put it into his pocket.</p>

<p>'Very well,' he said. 'Don't let me be disturbed again.'</p>

<p>When he came back to Clorinde, the young woman was
steeping her lips in the chartreuse, slowly sipping it, while
glancing upward at him with glistening eyes. There was a
tender look upon her face again.</p>

<p>Then, putting down her glass and leaning on the table, she
said, in a low voice: 'No, my dear fellow, you will never
know all that was done for you.'</p>

<p>Rougon drew his chair closer to hers and, in his turn, rested
his elbows on the table. 'Ah, you will tell me all about that
now, won't you?' he cried with animation. 'Don't let us
have any more mysteries, eh? Tell me all that you yourself
did.'</p>

<p>She shook her head, however, while pressing her cigarette
between her lips.</p>

<p>'What, is it something dreadful?' Rougon asked. 'Are
you afraid that I shouldn't be able to repay you? Wait a
moment, now; I'm going to try to guess. You wrote to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Pope and you dropped a bit of consecrated wafer into my
water jug without letting me know?'</p>

<p>Clorinde seemed vexed by this jesting, and threatened to
leave him if he continued it. 'Don't scoff at religion,' she
said. 'It will bring you misfortune.'</p>

<p>Then, waving away the smoke which she was puffing from
her lips and which seemed to inconvenience Rougon, she continued
in an expressive tone: 'I saw a great many people
indeed, and I won you several friends.'</p>

<p>She experienced a strong, an evil, inclination to tell him
everything, for she did not want him to remain ignorant of
the fact that she had done much for his advantage. Her confession
would be a first instalment towards the satisfaction
of her patiently hoarded rancour. 'Yes, yes,' she continued
significantly; 'I won over to your side several men who were
strongly opposed to you. And I destroyed the influence of
others.'</p>

<p>Rougon had turned very pale, for he understood her only
too well. 'Ah!' was all he said, as if to avoid the subject;
but Clorinde defiantly fixed her large black eyes upon him,
and giving way he began to question her. 'Monsieur de
Marsy, eh?'</p>

<p>Clorinde nodded assent and then blew a whiff of smoke
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>'Chevalier Rusconi?'</p>

<p>Again she nodded.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Lebeau, Monsieur de Salneuve, Monsieur
Guyot-Laplanche?'</p>

<p>She nodded at each name, and then finished her glass of
chartreuse in little sips, with an expression of triumph on her
face.</p>

<p>Rougon had risen from his seat. He walked to the end of
the room as if pondering, and then came back and stood
behind Clorinde. She could hear him panting. And all at
once she turned sharply, fearing he was going to kiss her
hair. 'I know your thoughts,' said she, 'but remember, I
had no need to plead your cause with yourself.'</p>

<p>Then, as he looked at her, white with anger, she burst
into a laugh. 'Oh! how simple you are!' she cried. 'If I
just joke a little, you believe all I say. Really, you are very
amusing.'</p>

<p>Rougon stood there for a moment quite nonplussed. The
ironical fashion in which she contradicted herself made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
more irritating and provoking. Her whole person, her
rippling laugh and glistening eyes, confirmed her confessions
and repeated them. However, just then there came a third
knock at the door.</p>

<p>'Well, I don't care, I shall stick to my cigarette this time,'
said Clorinde.</p>

<p>An usher came into the room, quite out of breath, and
stammered that the Minister of Justice wanted to speak to his
excellency. Then he cast a furtive glance at the lady he saw
smoking.</p>

<p>'Say that I have gone out!' retorted Rougon. 'I am not
at home to any one, do you hear!'</p>

<p>When the usher had bowed and retired backwards from
the room, Rougon vented his anger and brought his fist down
upon the table. He was scarcely allowed to breathe! he cried.
Why, on the previous day they had pursued him even to his
dressing-room where he had gone to shave.</p>

<p>Clorinde, however, rose from her chair and deliberately
walked to the door. 'Wait a moment,' she said; 'they sha'n't
disturb us again.' And then she quietly turned the key in the
lock. 'There!' she resumed. 'They may knock as much
as they like now.'</p>

<p>She began to roll a third cigarette as she stood near the
window. Rougon stepped up to her and whispered close to
her neck: 'Clorinde.'</p>

<p>She stood still, and he continued in deeper tones: 'Clorinde,
don't you know that I love you?'</p>

<p>She remained perfectly unruffled. She shook her head,
but so feebly that it seemed as if she wished to encourage him,
and he ended by planting a rough kiss on the back of her
neck, just beneath her hair. Then, however, she swung
herself round, and with scorn in her eyes and her voice she
cried: 'Ah! so you've got another attack, my friend? I
thought you were cured of that. What a strange man you
are! You kiss a woman after eighteen months' consideration!'</p>

<p>Rougon remained for a moment with downcast head, but
then sprang towards her, caught hold one of her hands and
began to cover it with kisses. She made no attempt to withdraw
it, but continued to jeer at him.</p>

<p>'Please don't bite my fingers. As long as you don't do
that, I don't mind. I should really never have believed it of
you! You had become so serious and steady when I went to
see you in the Rue Marbeuf. And now you're turned quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
crazy again! Truly, you're a nice kind of man! I can't
keep up a passion as you do. It's all quite over with me.
Remember that I offered to be your wife, but you refused me
then and now it is too late.'</p>

<p>'Hear me,' he murmured, 'I will do anything, everything,
you want.'</p>

<p>But the young woman shook her head, punishing him for
his old contempt, and enjoying, in so doing, a first instalment
of her vengeance. She had wanted to see him all-powerful
in order that she might in her turn treat him with
contempt.</p>

<p>Then Rougon fell ignominiously at her feet and began to
kiss her skirts, grovelling there, humbling himself, he who
could be so haughty with others. As he gradually grew
bolder, however, she said to him in a quiet voice: 'Take
care!' and as he disregarded her caution, she suddenly
touched his forehead with the burning end of her cigarette.
He recoiled with a faint cry, and she on her side darted away
and caught hold of the bell-rope which hung against the wall
beside the mantelpiece. 'I shall ring,' she said, 'and I shall
say it was you who locked the door!'</p>

<p>At this Rougon swung himself round, holding his hands to
his temples, and shaken by a violent tremor. Then for a
moment he remained quite still, feeling as though his head
were going to split. He stiffened himself in the hope of
calming his feverishness. There was a ringing in his ears,
and his eyes were blinded by ruddy fires.</p>

<p>'I am a brute,' he murmured at last. 'It is folly.'</p>

<p>Clorinde laughed triumphantly, and began to point a
moral. He did wrong to despise women, said she. Later on,
he would find that there were such things as very clever
women. Then she relapsed into a good-natured playful tone.
'You are not vexed with me, are you? You must never try
to make love to me again, you know. I don't want you to do
it. I don't like to think of it.'</p>

<p>Rougon paced up and down, full of shame; while she let
go of the bell-rope, sat down at the table again, and compounded
herself a glass of sugar and water.</p>

<p>'Well, I got a letter from my husband yesterday,' she
quietly resumed. 'I had so much to do this morning that I
should probably have broken my promise to come and lunch
with you if I hadn't wanted to show you that letter. See,
here it is! It reminds you of your promises.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Rougon took the letter and read it as he walked about the
room. Then he threw it on the table in front of Clorinde
with a gesture expressive of weariness.</p>

<p>'Well?' she asked.</p>

<p>He made no immediate reply, but stretched himself and
yawned. 'He is a simpleton,' he said at last.</p>

<p>Clorinde was greatly offended. For some time past she
had not tolerated any doubt of her husband's capabilities. She
bent her head for a moment and repressed the rebellious
twitchings of her hands. She was gradually emerging from
her disciple-like submissiveness, draining, as it were, from
Rougon sufficient of his strength to enable her to confront
him as a formidable foe.</p>

<p>'If we were to show this letter, it would be all over with
him,' said the minister, impelled by Clorinde's disdain to
avenge himself upon her husband. 'Ah! it isn't so easy
as you suppose to find a place that he's fit for.'</p>

<p>'You are exaggerating, my friend,' replied Clorinde, after
a short pause. 'You used to say that he had a great future
before him. He possesses some sterling good qualities; and
it isn't always the sharpest men who go furthest!'</p>

<p>Rougon, however, still paced the room, and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>'It is to your interest that he should join the ministry,'
continued Clorinde. 'You would have a supporter in him.
If it is true, as is reported, that the Minister of Commerce
and Agriculture is in bad health and wishes to retire, the
opportunity is a splendid one. My husband is quite competent
to perform the duties of the office, and his mission to Italy
would make his selection quite natural. You know that the
Emperor is very fond of him, and that they get on very well
together. They have the same ideas on many subjects. A
word from you would settle the matter.'</p>

<p>Rougon took two or three more turns before replying.
Then, halting in front of Clorinde, he said: 'Well, after all, I
am agreeable. He won't be the only simpleton in office.
But I'm doing this solely for your sake, remember. I want
to disarm you. I am afraid you haven't a good heart. You're
too vindictive, aren't you?'</p>

<p>He spoke playfully, and Clorinde laughed as she replied:
'Oh, yes, indeed; I'm very vindictive. I remember things a
long time.'</p>

<p>Then, as she was about to leave him, he detained her for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
a moment by the door, and twice squeezed her fingers, but
did not say another word.</p>

<p>Directly Clorinde had gone, Rougon returned to his private
office. The spacious room was empty. He sat down at the
writing-table and rested his elbows on his blotting-pad,
breathing heavily in the surrounding silence. His eyelids
dropped, and a deep reverie lulled him to a state of drowsiness
for the next ten minutes. Then he suddenly started,
stretched himself, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>Merle made his appearance.</p>

<p>'The prefect of the Somme is still here, isn't he?' asked
Rougon. 'Show him in.'</p>

<p>Bracing up his short figure, the prefect entered the room
with a pale, smiling face. He greeted the minister with all
due deference. Rougon, who felt little energy, waited till he
had finished. Then he asked him to be seated.</p>

<p>'I must tell you why I have sent for you, Monsieur le
préfet,' he began. 'There are certain instructions which
must be given by word of mouth. You are not ignorant of
the fact that the revolutionary party is raising its head. We
have been within an ace of a frightful catastrophe. The
country requires to be reassured, to feel that it can rely upon
the energetic protection of the Government. His Majesty the
Emperor, on his side, has come to the conclusion that some
examples must be made, for hitherto his kindness has been
strangely abused.'</p>

<p>Rougon spoke slowly, reclining in his arm-chair and
playing the while with a large agate seal. The prefect expressed
his approval of each sentence by a brisk nod.</p>

<p>'Your department,' continued the minister, 'is one of the
worst. The republican ulcer——'</p>

<p>'I make every effort——' interposed the prefect.</p>

<p>'Don't interrupt me. It is necessary that strong repressive
steps should be taken there; and it was to express my views
to you on the subject that I wished to see you. We have
been drawing up a list——'</p>

<p>Then he began to search among his papers, took up a
bundle of documents, and turned them over one by one.</p>

<p>'It is a return for the whole of France of the number of
arrests that are considered necessary. The number for each
department is proportionate to the blow which it is intended
to strike. I want you to understand our object thoroughly.
In the Haute-Marne, for instance, where the Republicans are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
in a very small minority, there are to be only three arrests.
In the Meuse, on the other hand, there will be fifteen. As
for your department, the Somme—isn't it?—well, for the
Somme, we think——'</p>

<p>He turned the papers over again, blinking his heavy eyelids;
then raised his head and looked the prefect in the face.
'Monsieur le préfet, you have twelve arrests to make,' said he.</p>

<p>The pale little man bowed. 'Twelve arrests,' he repeated.
'I understand your excellency perfectly.'</p>

<p>He seemed perplexed, however, as though affected by some
slight misgivings which he would have preferred to conceal.
However, after a few minutes' general conversation, just as
the minister rose to dismiss him, he made up his mind to
ask: 'Could your excellency tell me the persons who are to
be arrested?'</p>

<p>'Oh! arrest anybody you like!' Rougon replied. 'I can't
trouble myself about the details. I should never get through
the work if I did. Leave Paris this evening and begin your
arrests to-morrow. I advise you, however, to strike high.
Down in your department you have some lawyers and merchants
and druggists who busy themselves with politics.
Just lock all those fellows up. It will have a good effect.'</p>

<p>The prefect passed his hand across his brow in an anxious
way. He was already searching his memory, trying to think
of certain lawyers, merchants, and druggists. However, he
still nodded his head approvingly. But Rougon was not
altogether pleased with his hesitating demeanour. 'I won't
conceal from you,' he said, 'that his Majesty is by no means
satisfied just now with the administrative staff. There will
probably soon be a great change amongst the prefects. We
need very devoted men in the present grave circumstances.'</p>

<p>This affected the prefect like a cut from a whip.</p>

<p>'Your excellency may rely on me,' he exclaimed. 'I
have already fixed upon my men. There is a druggist at
Péronne, a cloth merchant and a paper maker at Doullens;
and, as for the lawyers, there's no lack of them; there's a
perfect plague of them. Oh, I assure your excellency that I
shall have no difficulty in making up the dozen. I am an
old servant of the Empire.'</p>

<p>For another moment he chattered on about devoting himself
to the saving of the country, and then took his leave with
a very low bow. When he had closed the door behind him,
the minister swayed his heavy frame with an air of doubt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
He did not believe in little men. Then, without sitting down
again, he drew a red line through La Somme upon his list.
The names of more than two-thirds of the departments were
already scored out in the same way.</p>

<p>When Rougon again rang for Merle, he was annoyed to
see that the ante-room was as full as ever. He fancied he
could recognise the two ladies still standing by the table. 'I
told you to send everybody away!' he cried. 'I am going
out, and cannot see anybody else.'</p>

<p>'The editor of the <i>Vœu National</i> is there,' murmured the
usher.</p>

<p>Rougon had forgotten the editor. He clasped his hands
behind his back, and ordered Merle to admit him. The
journalist was a man of some forty years of age, with a heavy
face, and was very carefully dressed.</p>

<p>'Ah! here you are, sir!' said the minister roughly.
'Things cannot go on like this, I warn you of it.'</p>

<p>Then he began to pace the room, inveighing hotly against
the press. It was demoralising everything, bringing about
general disorganisation, and inciting to disorder of every kind.
The very robbers who stabbed wayfarers on the high-roads
were preferable to journalists, said he. A man might recover
from a knife-thrust, but pens were poisoned. Then he went
on to make even more odious comparisons; and gradually
worked himself into a state of excitement, gesticulating
angrily, and thundering forth his words. The editor, who
had remained standing, bent his head to the storm, while his
face wore an expression of submissive consternation.</p>

<p>'If your excellency would condescend to explain to me,' he
at last ventured to say; 'I don't quite understand——'</p>

<p>'What?' roared Rougon furiously. Then he sprang
forward, spread out the newspaper on his table, and pointed
to the columns that were marked with red pencil. 'There
are not ten lines free from offence!' he exclaimed. 'In your
leading article, you appear to cast a doubt upon the government's
capacities in the matter of repressive measures. In
this paragraph on the second page you appear to allude to me
when you speak of the insolent triumph of parvenus. Among
your miscellaneous items there are a lot of filthy stories, brainless
attacks upon the upper classes.'</p>

<p>The editor clasped his hands in great alarm, and tried to
get in a word. 'I assure your excellency—I am quite in
despair that your excellency could suppose for a moment—I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
too, who have such very warm admiration for your
excellency——'</p>

<p>Rougon, however, paid no attention to this. 'And the
worst of the matter is, sir,' he continued, 'that everyone is
aware of your connection with the administration. How is it
likely that the other newspapers will respect us, when those
in our own pay do not? All my friends have been denouncing
these abominations to me this morning.'</p>

<p>Then the editor joined Rougon in declaiming against the
incriminated matter. He had read none of those articles and
paragraphs, he said. But he would at once dismiss all his
contributors. If his excellency wished it, he would send him
a proof-copy of the paper every morning. Rougon, who had
relieved his feelings, declined this offer. He had not the time
to examine a proof-copy, he said. Just as he was dismissing
the editor, however, a fresh thought seemed to strike him.
'Oh, I was forgetting,' he said. 'That well-bred woman who
betrays her husband in the novel you are publishing serially
supplies a detestable argument against good education. It
ought not to be alleged that a woman of that kind could
possibly commit such a sin.'</p>

<p>'The serial has had a great success,' murmured the editor,
again feeling alarmed. 'I have read it, and have found it
very interesting.'</p>

<p>'Ah! you've read it, have you? Well, now, does this
wretched woman feel any remorse in the end?'</p>

<p>The editor carried his hand to his forehead, amazed, and
trying to remember. 'Remorse? No, I think not,' he
replied. Rougon had already opened the door, and as he
closed it upon the journalist, he called after him: 'It is absolutely
necessary that she should feel remorse! Insist upon
the author filling her with remorse!'</p>

<h3>A TRIP TO NIORT</h3>


<p>Rougon had written to Du Poizat and M. Kahn asking them
to spare him the infliction of an official reception at the gates
of Niort. He arrived there one Saturday evening a little before
seven o'clock, and at once went to the prefecture, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
intention of resting till noon the following day, for he was
feeling very tired. After dinner, however, several people
called. Doubtless the news of the minister's arrival had
already spread through the town. A small drawing-room
near the dining-room was thrown open, and a kind of impromptu
reception was organised. Rougon, as he stood
between the two windows, was obliged to stifle his yawns and
reply as pleasantly as he could to the greetings offered to
him.</p>

<p>One of the deputies of the department, the very attorney
who had usurped M. Kahn's position as official candidate, was
the first to make his appearance. He arrived quite out of
breath, half scared, wearing a frock-coat and coloured trousers,
for which he apologised on the ground that he had only just
returned on foot from one of his farms, and had been anxious
to pay his respects to his excellency as soon as possible. Then
a short fat man appeared, wearing a somewhat tight-fitting
dress coat and white gloves. There was an air of ceremonious
regret about him. He was the mayor's first assessor, and had
just been informed by his servant of Rougon's arrival. The
mayor, he said, would be greatly distressed. He was not
expecting his excellency till the following day and was at
present at his estate of Les Varades, some six miles off. After
the assessor there came a procession of six gentlemen with
big feet, big hands, and big heavy faces. The prefect presented
them to Rougon as distinguished members of the
Statistical Society. Then the head-master of the state college
arrived, bringing with him his wife, a charming blonde of
eight-and-twenty. She was a Parisienne, and her dresses were
the wonder of Niort. She told Rougon somewhat bitterly of
her great dislike for provincial life.</p>

<p>M. Kahn, who had dined with the minister and the prefect,
was on his side hotly plied with questions respecting the next
day's ceremony. It had been arranged that the party would
repair to a spot some two or three miles from the town, in the
district known as Les Moulins, where it was intended that
the first tunnel on the new line from Niort to Angers should
be pierced; and there the Minister of the Interior was to fire
the first mine. Rougon, who had assumed a homely good-natured
manner, said that he merely wanted to do what he
could to honour an old friend's laborious enterprise. He
moreover considered himself to be an adopted son of the
department of Deux-Sèvres, which in former days had sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
him to the Legislative Assembly. To tell the truth, however,
the real object of his journey was in accordance with Du
Poizat's strongly urged advice to display himself, in the plenitude
of power, to his old constituents, so as to make sure of
their support should it ever become necessary for him to enter
the Corps Législatif.</p>

<p>From the windows of the little drawing-room the town
could be seen black and slumberous. No further visitors
called. The news of the minister's arrival had come too late
in the day. This circumstance, however, gave an additional
feeling of triumph to the few zealous ones who had put in an
appearance at the prefect's. They gave no hint of retiring,
but seemed quite elated with joy at being the first to meet his
excellency in private conversation. The mayor's assessor
repeated in a doleful voice, through which rang a note of
jubilation: '<i>Mon Dieu</i>! how distressed the mayor will be!
And the presiding judge, too, and the public prosecutor and
all the other gentlemen!'</p>

<p>Towards nine o'clock, however, it might have been supposed
that the whole town was in the ante-room, for a loud tramping
of feet was heard there. Then a servant entered the drawing-room
and announced that the chief commissary of police
desired to pay his respects to his excellency. And it was
Gilquin who made his appearance: Gilquin, looking quite
gorgeous in evening dress and straw-coloured gloves and kid
boots. Du Poizat had given him a place in his department.
He bore himself very well, the only traces of his old manner
being a somewhat swaggering motion of his shoulders and a
marked disinclination to part with his hat, which he persisted
in holding against his hip in imitation of a pose which he had
studied on a tailor's fashion-plate. He bowed to Rougon and
addressed him with exaggerated humility. 'I venture to recall
myself to the kind recollection of your excellency, whom I
had the honour of meeting several times in Paris,' said he.</p>

<p>Rougon smiled, and he and Gilquin chatted for a few
moments. Then the latter made his way into the dining-room,
where tea had just been served, and he there found M. Kahn,
who was glancing over a list of the guests invited to the next
day's ceremony. In the little drawing-room the conversation
had now turned upon the grandeur of the Emperor's reign.
Du Poizat, standing by Rougon's side, was extolling the
Empire, and they bowed to one another as though they were
mutually congratulating themselves upon some personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
achievement, while the citizens of Niort clustered round,
agape with respectful admiration.</p>

<p>'What clever fellows they are, eh?' said Gilquin, who
was watching the scene through the open doorway.</p>

<p>Then, as he proceeded to pour some rum into his tea, he
gave M. Kahn a nudge. Du Poizat, lean and enthusiastic,
with his irregular white teeth and feverish, childish face all
aglow with triumph, appeared to take Gilquin's fancy. 'Ah,
you should have seen him when he first arrived in the department,'
said the commissary in a low voice. 'I was with him.
He stamped his feet angrily as he walked along. He no
doubt felt a grudge against the people here: and since he's
been prefect, he's been amusing himself by avenging all his
youthful grievances. The townspeople who knew him when
he was a poor miserable fellow don't feel inclined to smile
now when they see him go past. He makes a strong prefect;
he's quite cut out for the post. He's very different from that
fellow Langlade, whom he superseded, a mere ladies' man, as
fair as a girl. We came across photographs of ladies in very
low dresses even amongst the official papers in his room.'</p>

<p>Then Gilquin paused. He fancied that the wife of the
head-master had her eyes on him. And so, desirous of displaying
the graces of his person, he bent forward again to speak
to M. Kahn. 'Have you heard of Du Poizat's meeting with
his father?' he asked. 'Oh, it was the most amusing thing
in the world. The old man, you know, is a retired process-server,
who has got a nice little pile together by lending petty
sums by the week at high interest; and he now lives like a
wolf in an old ruin of a house where he keeps loaded guns in
the hall. Well, he had told his son a score of times that he
would come to the gallows; and Du Poizat had long dreamt
of having his revenge. That, indeed, was one of his reasons
for wanting to be prefect here. So one morning he put on
his finest uniform, and, under the pretext of making a round,
he went and knocked at the old man's house. Then, after a
good quarter of an hour's parley, the father opened the door,
a pale little old man he was, and he gazed with a stupefied
look at his son's gold-laced uniform. Well, now, guess what
was the first thing he said, as soon as he discovered that his son
had become the prefect! "Don't send for the taxes any more,
Leopold!" Yes, those were his very words. He didn't show
the slightest fatherly emotion. When Du Poizat came back,
he was biting his lips, and his face was as white as a sheet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
His father's unruffled tranquillity had quite exasperated him.
Ah! he'll never manage to subdue the old man!'</p>

<p>M. Kahn nodded his head discreetly. He had slipped the
list of guests into his pocket, and was now sipping a cup of tea
while glancing occasionally into the adjoining room. 'Rougon
is half asleep,' he said. 'Those idiots ought to have enough
sense to leave him and let him go to bed. I want him to be
in good form for to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'I hadn't seen him for some time,' said Gilquin. 'He has
put on more flesh.' Then, lowering his voice, he continued:
'They managed it very cleverly, those two fine fellows! They
worked some quiet trick or other out of that bomb affair at
the Opera which I had warned them of. It came off, as you
know; but Rougon pretends that he went to the prefecture
and that no one there would believe him. Well, that's his
business, and there's no occasion to say any more about it.
On the day of the affair, Du Poizat stood me a ripping
<i>déjeuner</i> at a café on the boulevards. Oh! what a time we
had! We went to a theatre in the evening, I think, but I
haven't any very distinct recollection of it, for I slept for two
days afterwards.'</p>

<p>M. Kahn now appeared to find Gilquin's confidences
somewhat alarming, for he got up and left the dining-room.
Then the commissary felt quite convinced that the head-master's
wife was certainly gazing at him. So he also went
back into the drawing-room and busied himself about her, and
ended by bringing her some tea, biscuits and cake. He really
carried himself very well; he looked like a gentleman who
had been badly brought up, and this appeared to influence the
beautiful blonde in his favour.</p>

<p>However, the deputy was now engaged in demonstrating
the necessity of having a new church at Niort; the mayor's
assessor asked for a bridge; and the head-master urged the
desirability of extending the college buildings, while the six
members of the Statistical Society silently nodded approval of
everything.</p>

<p>'Well, we will see about these matters to-morrow, gentlemen,'
said Rougon, whose eyelids were half-closed. 'I am
here for the purpose of inquiring into your needs and doing
what I can to satisfy them.'</p>

<p>Ten o'clock was just striking when a servant came into
the room and said something to the prefect, who at once
whispered a few words in the minister's ear. The latter then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
hastened out of the drawing room. He found Madame
Correur waiting for him in an adjoining apartment. She was
accompanied by a tall, slim girl with a colourless freckled
face.</p>

<p>'So you are in Niort, are you?' Rougon exclaimed as he
joined them.</p>

<p>'Only since this afternoon,' replied Madame Correur. 'We
are staying just opposite, on the Place de la Préfecture, at the
Hôtel de Paris.'</p>

<p>And then she explained that she had come from Coulonges,
where she had been spending a couple of days. But suddenly
she paused to direct the minister's attention to the tall girl
beside her. 'This,' said she, 'is Mademoiselle Herminie
Billecoq, who has been kind enough to accompany me.'</p>

<p>Herminie Billecoq made a ceremonious bow, and Madame
Correur proceeded: 'I didn't say anything to you about this
expedition of mine, because I thought you might oppose it;
but I really couldn't help going. I was very anxious to see
my brother. When I heard of your coming to Niort, I
hastened here. We looked out for you and saw you enter
the prefecture, but we thought it better to defer our visit
till later on. These little towns are much given to malicious
scandal!'</p>

<p>Rougon nodded assent. He was indeed thinking that
plump Madame Correur with her painted face and bright
yellow dress might, to provincial eyes, very well appear to be
a compromising person.</p>

<p>'Well, and did you see your brother?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Madame Correur replied, clenching her teeth; 'yes,
I saw him. Madame Martineau didn't venture to turn me
out of the house. She was burning some sugar over the fire
when I went in. Oh, my poor brother! I knew that he was
ill, but it gave me quite a shock to see him so emaciated. He
has promised that he won't disinherit me; it would be contrary
to his principles. He has made his will; and his
property will be divided between me and Madame Martineau.
Isn't that so, Herminie?'</p>

<p>'Yes, the property is to be divided,' declared the tall girl.
'He told you so when you first got there, and repeated it
when he saw you away from the door. Oh! there's no doubt
about it; I heard him say so.'</p>

<p>Then Rougon tried to get rid of the two women by saying:
'Well, I'm delighted to hear it. You will feel much easier now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
These family quarrels always get made up. Come, good-night;
I'm going to bed now.'</p>

<p>But Madame Correur detained him. She had taken her
handkerchief out of her pocket and was dabbing her eyes with
it, seemingly affected with sudden grief. 'Oh, my poor
Martineau!' said she, 'he was so kind and good, and forgave
me with such readiness! I wish you knew how good he is, my
dear friend. It is on his account that I have hurried here, to
petition you in his favour——'</p>

<p>Her tears prevented her from saying more, and she began
to sob. Rougon was at a loss to know what it meant, and
looked at the two women in astonishment. Then Mademoiselle
Herminie Billecoq also began to cry, but less demonstratively
than Madame Correur. She was a very sensitive
young person, and was readily affected by another's grief.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Martineau has compromised himself in politics,'
she stammered amidst her tears.</p>

<p>Thereupon Madame Correur began to speak with great
volubility. 'You will remember,' she said, 'that I hinted my
fears to you one day. I had a presentiment of what would
happen. Martineau was showing Republican proclivities. At
the last election he behaved very wildly, and made the most
desperate exertions in favour of the opposition candidate. I
was aware of things which I don't want to mention. However,
it was all bound to have a bad result. When I got to
the Golden Lion at Coulonges, where we had engaged a room,
I questioned the people there, and I learnt a good deal more
from them. Martineau has been guilty of all kinds of follies.
No one in the neighbourhood would be surprised if he
were to be arrested. Every day they expect to see the
gendarmes come and take him off. You can imagine what a
shock this was to me! And so I thought of you, my dear
friend——'</p>

<p>Her utterance was again choked by her sobs. Then
Rougon tried to reassure her. He would mention the subject
to Du Poizat, he said, and he would stop any proceedings that
might have been instituted. 'I am the master,' he even
added; 'come, go to bed and sleep quietly.'</p>

<p>But Madame Correur shook her head and twisted her
pocket-handkerchief. Her eyes were quite dry now. 'Ah!
you don't know everything,' she said. 'It is a more serious
matter than you suppose. He takes Madame Martineau to
mass, but stays outside himself and proclaims that he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
sets foot in a church; and this causes a dreadful scandal
every Sunday. Then, too, he frequents a retired lawyer in
the neighbourhood, one of the men of '48, and can be heard
talking to him for hours in the most dreadful way. Suspicious-looking
men, too, have often been seen to slip into his garden
at night-time, with the intention, no doubt, of receiving
directions from him.'</p>

<p>Rougon shrugged his shoulders at each fresh detail, but
Mademoiselle Herminie Billecoq, as though shocked by such
tolerance, added sharply: 'And he receives letters with red
seals from all sorts of countries. The postman told us that.
He didn't want to speak about it at first, he was quite pale.
We had to give him twenty sous. And then, a month ago,
Monsieur Martineau left home for a week, without anyone in
the neighbourhood having the slightest idea where he went.
The landlady of the Golden Lion told us that he hadn't even
taken any luggage with him.'</p>

<p>'Herminie, I beg of you to be quiet!' said Madame
Correur uneasily. 'Martineau has got quite sufficient against
him as it is. There is no occasion for us to add any more.'</p>

<p>Rougon was now listening and glancing at the two women
in turn. He had become very serious. 'Well, if he has
compromised himself so much as that——' he began, pausing,
however, as he fancied that he could detect a fiery gleam
igniting in Madame Correur's troubled eyes. 'Well, I will
do all I can,' he resumed; 'but I make no promises.'</p>

<p>'It is all up with him; it is all up with him!' exclaimed
Madame Correur. 'I feel quite certain of it. We don't want
to say anything; but if we told all——' Then in her turn
she paused and began to bite her pocket handkerchief. 'And
to think that I hadn't seen him for twenty years, and have
only now just seen him to be parted from him for ever, perhaps!
He was so kind, so very kind!'</p>

<p>Herminie, however, gently shrugged her shoulders and
made signs to Rougon, as if to tell him that he must excuse a
sister's despair, but that the old attorney was really a great
rascal. 'If I were you,' she said to Madame Correur, 'I
would tell everything. It will be much the best.'</p>

<p>Then the elder woman seemed to brace herself up for a great
effort. 'You remember,' she said, lowering her voice, 'the
"Te Deums," which were sung everywhere, when the Emperor
so miraculously escaped being murdered in front of the
Opera-house? Well, on the very day when they were singing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the "Te Deum" at Coulonges, one of Martineau's neighbours
asked him if he wasn't going to church, and the wretched
man replied, "Why should I go to church, indeed? I don't
care a fig for your Emperor!"'</p>

<p>'I don't care a fig for your Emperor!' repeated Mademoiselle
Herminie Billecoq, with an air of consternation.</p>

<p>'You can understand my alarm now,' continued the retired
boarding-house keeper. 'As I told you before, no one in the
neighbourhood would be the least surprised to see him
arrested.'</p>

<p>As she spoke these last words, she fixed her eyes searchingly
on Rougon. He made no immediate reply. He seemed
to be trying to read her flabby face, her pale eyes, which blinked
beneath light and scanty brows. For a moment his gaze
rested on her plump white neck. Then he threw out his arms
and said: 'I can do nothing, I assure you. I am not the
master.'</p>

<p>And he gave his reasons. He felt certain scruples, he
said, about interfering in affairs of this kind. If the law had
been invoked, matters would have to take their course. It
would even have been better if he had not known Madame
Correur, as his friendship for her would tie his hands, for he
had sworn never to render certain services to his friends.
However, he would inquire into the matter. And he tried to
console her, as though her brother were already on his way
to some penal settlement. She bent her head, and her sobs
shook the big coil of light hair which lay on the nape of her
neck. Presently she grew calmer, and as she took leave,
she pushed Herminie in front of her, exclaiming: 'Mademoiselle
Herminie Billecoq; but I fancy I have already
introduced her to you. Please excuse me, my head is in such
a state. She is the young lady for whom we succeeded in
obtaining a dowry. The officer who seduced her has not yet
been able to marry her on account of the interminable formalities
which have to be gone through. Thank his excellency,
my dear.'</p>

<p>The tall girl expressed her thanks, blushing, as she did so,
like an innocent maiden in whose presence some indelicate
remark has been made. Madame Correur let her leave the
room before her; then she pressed Rougon's hand tightly,
and, bending towards him, said: 'I rely upon you, Eugène!'</p>

<p>When the minister returned to the little drawing-room, he
found it deserted. Du Poizat had succeeded in getting rid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
the deputy, the mayor's assessor and the six members of the
Statistical Society. M. Kahn had also taken his departure, after
making an appointment for ten o'clock the next morning. In
the dining-room there only remained the head-master's wife
and Gilquin, who were eating little cakes, and chatting about
Paris. Gilquin made soft eyes at the lady and talked to her
about the races, the picture-shows, and a new piece at the
Comédie Française, with the ease of a man to whom all kinds
of life were familiar. The head-master, in the meantime, was
speaking in a low tone to the prefect about the fourth form
professor, who was suspected of Republican proclivities.</p>

<p>However, eleven o'clock struck. The remaining visitors
rose and bowed to his excellency, and Gilquin was just about
to retire with the head-master and his wife, to the latter of
whom he had offered his arm, when Rougon detained him.</p>

<p>'Monsieur le Commissaire,' he said, 'a word with you, I
beg.'</p>

<p>When they were alone together, he addressed himself to
the commissary and prefect simultaneously: 'What is this
business of Martineau's?' he asked. 'Has the man really
compromised himself?'</p>

<p>Gilquin smiled, and Du Poizat proceeded to give a few
particulars: 'I wasn't thinking of taking any steps in the
affair,' he said. 'The man has certainly been denounced to
me, and I have received letters about him. There is no doubt
that he mixes himself up in politics. But there have already
been four arrests in the department, and I should have preferred
making up my five, which was the number you fixed,
by locking up the master of the fourth form at the college
here who reads revolutionary books to his pupils.'</p>

<p>'I have been told of some very serious things,' said
Rougon sternly. 'His sister's tears must not be allowed to
save this man Martineau, if he is really as dangerous as is
alleged. The public safety is at stake.' Then he turned
towards Gilquin. 'What is your opinion on the matter?' he
asked.</p>

<p>'I will arrest him in the morning,' the commissary replied.
'I know all about the matter. I have seen Madame Correur
at the Hôtel de Paris, where I generally dine.'</p>

<p>Du Poizat made no objection. He took a little memorandum-book
from his pocket, struck out a name, and wrote
another in its place, at the same time recommending the commissary
of police to keep his eye upon the master of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
fourth form. Rougon accompanied Gilquin to the door.
'This man Martineau is not very well, I believe,' he said.
'Go to Coulonges yourself, and treat him decently.'</p>

<p>Gilquin pulled himself up with an offended air, and setting
aside all respect for his excellency, familiarly exclaimed:
'Do you take me for a mere common policeman? Ask Du
Poizat to tell you about the druggist whom I arrested on the
day before yesterday. There was a lady with him, but nobody
knows it. I always act with the greatest discretion.'</p>

<p>Rougon slept soundly for nine hours. When he opened
his eyes the next morning, at about half-past eight, he sent a
message for Du Poizat to come to him. The prefect arrived
with a cigar in his mouth, and seemed in high spirits. They
talked and joked together as they had done in former days,
when they had lodged at Madame Correur's, and had roused
each other with playful slaps. However, while the minister
was washing, he questioned the prefect about the neighbourhood,
asking for particulars of the different officials and
their various desires and vanities. He wanted to have a
pleasant remark ready for each of them.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't worry yourself,' replied Du Poizat, with a
laugh; 'I will prompt you.'</p>

<p>Then he gave him some information about the different
people with whom he would come into contact. Rougon
occasionally made him repeat what he said in order to impress
it upon his memory. At ten o'clock, M. Kahn made his
appearance. They all three had <i>déjeuner</i> together, and
finally arranged the details of the ceremony. The prefect
would make a speech, as would also M. Kahn. Rougon
would follow the latter; but they considered that a fourth
speech would be desirable. For a moment they thought of
the mayor, but Du Poizat declared that he was a stupid fellow,
and advised the selection of the chief surveyor of bridges
and highways, to whom the proceedings of the day naturally
seemed to point, though M. Kahn was afraid of this official's
spirit of criticism. As they got up from table, M. Kahn took
the minister aside to tell him of the points which he hoped
he would bring forward in his speech.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that the party should meet at the
prefecture at half-past ten. The mayor and his assessor arrived
together. The former stammered forth his unbounded regret
that he had been absent from Niort on the previous evening,
while the latter affectedly hoped that his excellency had slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
well, and had quite recovered from his fatigue. Then the
President of the Civil Tribunal, the public prosecutor and his
two assessors, and the chief surveyor of bridges and highways
made their appearance. They were quickly followed by the
receiver-general, the comptroller of the direct taxes, and the
registrar of the department. Several of these officials were
accompanied by their wives. The wife of the head-master of
the college, the beautiful blonde, wore a most effective sky-blue
dress, and attracted great attention. She begged his
excellency to excuse her husband, who had been prevented
from coming by an attack of gout, which had seized him soon
after his return home on the previous evening. However,
other personages were arriving; the colonel of the seventy-eighth
regiment of the Line, which was stationed at Niort;
the President of the Tribunal of Commerce, the two justices
of the peace, the conservator of rivers and forests, accompanied
by his three daughters, with various municipal councillors
and delegates from the consultative Chamber of Arts
and Manufactures, the Statistical Society, and the Council of
the Board of Arbitration between employers and employed.</p>

<p>The reception was held in the large drawing-room of the
prefecture. Du Poizat made the presentations, and the
minister received all the guests with smiling bows as though
they were old friends. He exhibited wonderful knowledge
about each of them. He spoke to the public prosecutor of a
speech lately made by him in the course of a trial for
adultery; he asked the comptroller of taxes, in sympathetic
tones, after the health of his wife, who had been laid up for
the last two months; he detained the colonel of the seventy-eighth
for a moment to let him see that he was not unacquainted
with the brilliant progress made by his son at
Saint Cyr; he talked about boots to a municipal councillor,
who owned a great boot-making establishment; while with
the registrar, who was an enthusiastic archæologist, he discussed
a druidical stone which had been discovered during
the previous week. Whenever he hesitated, thinking of the
right thing to say, Du Poizat came to his assistance and
cleverly prompted him in a whisper.</p>

<p>As the President of the Tribunal of Commerce came into
the room and bowed to him, Rougon exclaimed, in an affable
voice: 'Ah! are you alone, Monsieur le Président? At all
events I trust that we shall have the pleasure of seeing your
wife at the banquet this evening——'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped short, noticing the expression of embarrassment
which came over the faces around him. Du Poizat,
moreover, nudged his elbow. Then he recollected that the
President of the Tribunal of Commerce was living apart from
his wife in consequence of certain scandals. He had made a
mistake. He had thought that he was addressing the other
president, the chief judge of the Civil Tribunal. However,
he was in no way disconcerted. He still smiled; and,
making no reference to his unfortunate remark, continued,
with a shrewd air: 'I have a pleasant piece of news for you,
monsieur. I know that my colleague, the Minister of
Justice, has put your name down for the cross of the Legion
of Honour. Perhaps I ought not to have mentioned it, but
you will keep my secret.'</p>

<p>The President of the Tribunal of Commerce turned quite
scarlet. He almost choked with joy. His friends pressed
round him to congratulate him, while Rougon made a mental
note of this cross—which he had so opportunely thought of
bestowing—so that he might not forget to mention the matter
to his colleague. It was the betrayed husband that he was
decorating. Du Poizat smiled with admiration.</p>

<p>There were now some fifty people in the drawing-room.
They still waited on; but the faces of many of them were
beginning to show signs of weariness.</p>

<p>'Time is flying; we might perhaps make a start,' said the
minister.</p>

<p>But the prefect bent towards him, and explained that the
deputy, M. Kahn's former opponent, had not yet arrived.
Presently, however, this gentleman made his appearance,
perspiring profusely. His watch had stopped, he said, and
he had been quite put out of his reckoning. Then, wishing
to let the company know of his visit on the previous evening,
he went on to remark, in a loud voice: 'As I was saying to
your excellency last night——' And afterwards he walked
off alongside of Rougon and informed him that he intended
to return to Paris on the following morning. The Easter
recess had terminated on the previous Tuesday, and the
Chamber was again sitting. He had considered it his duty,
however, to remain for a few days longer at Niort in order to
welcome his excellency to the department.</p>

<p>All the guests trooped into the courtyard of the prefecture,
where ten carriages, drawn up on either side of the steps, were
awaiting them. The minister, the deputy, the prefect and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
the mayor got into the first barouche. The others installed
themselves as hierarchically as they could. There were two
more barouches as well as three victorias, and some waggonettes
with seats for six or eight persons. The procession
formed up in the Rue de la Préfecture, and started off at a
gentle trot. The ladies' ribbons streamed in the air, and
here and there their skirts protruded out of the carriages,
while the gentlemen's black hats shone brightly in the sun.
The procession had to pass through a considerable section of
the town; and, owing to the rough pavement of the narrow
streets, the vehicles jolted dreadfully as they passed on with
a crash like that of iron. And at every door and every
window were townsfolk who bowed in silence while looking
for his excellency, and experiencing much surprise when they
saw his plain frock-coat beside the prefect's gold-laced
uniform.</p>

<p>On leaving the town, the procession passed along a wide
promenade planted with magnificent trees. It was a warm,
pleasant, April day, with a clear sky full of sunlight. The
road, which was straight and level, lay between gardens gay
with blossoming lilacs and apricot trees. Presently, however,
cultivated fields spread out, dotted here and there with
copses.</p>

<p>'That's a spinning mill, isn't it?' asked Rougon, towards
whom the prefect had just bent. 'A mill which belongs to
you, I believe,' he continued, addressing the mayor, and
calling his attention to a red brick building on the river bank.
'I have heard of your new system of wool carding. I will
try to find time to go and inspect all those wonders.'</p>

<p>Then he began to ask some questions respecting the
motive power of the river. In his opinion, said he, hydraulic
power, under favourable conditions, possessed enormous
advantages. He quite astonished the mayor by the amount
of technical knowledge he displayed. Meantime the other
carriages followed on in somewhat irregular fashion.
Snatches of conversation, bristling with figures, could be
heard amidst the jog-trot of the horses. Then a rippling
laugh attracted everyone's attention. It came from the head-master's
wife, whose sun-shade had just flown away and
fallen on to a heap of stones.</p>

<p>'You have a farm about here, haven't you?' said Rougon,
turning to the deputy with a smile. 'That's it on the hill, if
I'm not mistaken. What splendid meadows! I know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
you interest yourself in cattle-breeding, and won several
prizes at the last shows.'</p>

<p>Then they began to talk about cattle. Steeped in the
sunshine, the meadows looked like soft green velvet. Wild
flowers were springing up all over them. Athwart the
curtains of tall poplar trees one had glimpses of charming bits
of landscape. However, an old woman leading an ass came
along and was obliged to stop at the roadside to let the procession
pass. The ass, frightened by the sight of so many
carriages with panels gleaming in the sunshine, began to
bray; but the gaily dressed ladies and begloved gentlemen
remained perfectly serious.</p>

<p>The procession now climbed a slight hill on the left, and
then descended again. They had reached the scene of the
ceremony. It was a sort of <i>cul-de-sac</i>, a hollow gap walled in
by hills on three sides. Nothing broke upon the prospect save
the gaping ruins of a couple of windmills. And in this
hollow, in the centre of a patch of grass land, a tent of grey
canvas, with a wide crimson border, had been set up; its four
sides were decorated with trophies of flags. A thousand
sight-seers, middle-class folks and peasants whose curiosity
had induced them to walk over, had taken up position in the
shade on the right-hand side, where one of the hills rose up
like an amphitheatre. A detachment of the seventy-eighth
regiment was ranged in front of the tent, opposite the Niort
firemen, whose fine bearing was much noticed; while a gang
of navvies in new blouses, with engineers in frock-coats at
their head, stood waiting at the edge of the patch of grass. As
soon as the carriages appeared, the Niort Philharmonic Society,
composed of amateur instrumentalists, began to play the
overture to 'La Dame Blanche.'</p>

<p>'Long live his excellency! cried a few persons whose
voices were drowned by the sound of the instruments.</p>

<p>Rougon alighted from his carriage, raised his eyes, and
looked about the hollow in which he found himself, vexed to
find the spot so small, so shut in, for this seemed to detract
from the impressiveness of the ceremony. He stood for a
moment on the grass, waiting for some one to receive him.
At last M. Kahn hastened up. He had left the prefecture
immediately after <i>déjeuner</i>, and had just been to examine the
mine which his excellency was to fire, to see if all were right.
It was he who conducted the minister into the tent; and
then the guests followed. There was some little confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
for a moment; and Rougon began to ask for particulars.
'It is yonder, then, in that cutting, that the tunnel is to
commence?'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' replied M. Kahn. 'The first mine has been
laid in that reddish rock where your excellency sees a flag
flying.'</p>

<p>The hill-side at the end of the hollow had been broken up
by picks till its rocky base was disclosed to view. Several
uprooted trees were lying about amongst the excavations, and
the cutting was strewn with foliage. M. Kahn pointed out
the course the line would take. It was marked by a double
row of stakes stretching away amid grass and paths and
thickets. It was a pretty piece of quiet country that they
were going to rip up.</p>

<p>However, the guests and officials had by this time collected
in the tent. Some curious sight-seers in the rear were bending
forward to glance through the openings, and the instrumentalists
of the Philharmonic Society was just finishing the
overture to 'La Dame Blanche.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur le ministre,' suddenly exclaimed a shrill voice
which vibrated amidst the silence, 'it is my privilege to be
the first to thank your excellency for having so kindly
accepted the invitation which we ventured to address to you.
The department of Deux-Sèvres will ever preserve a grateful
recollection——'</p>

<p>It was Du Poizat who had begun to speak. He stood some
three yards away from Rougon; and at the finish of certain
sentences they slightly bowed to one another. The prefect
went on speaking for a good quarter of an hour. He reminded
the minister of the brilliant fashion in which he had represented
the department in the Legislative Assembly. The
town of Niort had then inscribed his name in its annals as
that of a benefactor, and longed for any occasion upon which
it might show its gratitude. Every now and then the prefect's
voice was quite lost in the air, and only his gestures, an even,
regular working of his right arm, could be seen; and then the
crowd ranged on the hill-side gave their attention to the gold
embroidery on his sleeve, which flashed brightly in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>Afterwards, however, M. Kahn stepped into the middle of
the tent. He had a very deep voice, and seemed to bark out
some of his words. The hill-side gave an echo which repeated
snatches of sentences upon which he lingered too complacently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
He spoke of all the long efforts, studies and toilsome steps
which had devolved upon him during nearly four years in his
struggle to obtain a new line for the district. Now, every
kind of prosperity would rain down upon the department.
The fields would be fertilised; the factories would double
their output; and commerce would make its way into the
humblest villages. To hear him talk, it might have been
supposed that Deux-Sèvres was about to become a sort of
fairy-land, with rivers of milk and enchanted groves, where
tables laden with good things would await every passer-by.
All at once, however, he affected an exaggerated modesty.
They owed him, said he, no gratitude whatever. He himself
could never have carried out such a vast scheme without the
high patronage of which he was so proud. Then, turning
towards Rougon, he called him 'the illustrious minister, the
promoter and supporter of every useful and noble idea.' In
conclusion, he dwelt upon the financial advantages of the
scheme. At the Bourse, he said, people were fighting for the
shares. Happy were those who had been able to invest their
money in an enterprise with which his Excellency, the Minister
of the Interior had been willing to connect his name!</p>

<p>'Hear! hear!' cried some of the guests.</p>

<p>The mayor and several of the officials grasped M. Kahn's
hand. He affected to be greatly moved. Outside there were
bursts of cheering, and the bandsmen of the Philharmonic
Society considered it proper to strike up a quick march.
Thereupon the mayor's assessor sprang forward and sent a
fireman to silence them. In the meantime, the chief surveyor
of bridges and highways was hesitating and repeating that he
had prepared no speech for the occasion. However, as the
prefect continued to press him, he gave way. At this M. Kahn
seemed very uneasy, and murmured to Du Poizat: 'You've
made a mistake. He's sure to say something nasty.'</p>

<p>The chief surveyor was a tall, lean man, who considered
himself endowed with great powers of irony. He spoke slowly,
and gave a twist to his mouth every time he delivered himself
of one of his epigrammatic thrusts. He commenced his speech
by overwhelming M. Kahn with praises. Then the unpleasant
remarks began; and he briefly criticised the projected railway
with all the contempt of a government engineer for the plans
and designs of a private one. He referred to the opposition
scheme of the Western Company, which had contemplated
carrying the line past Thouars, and he laid stress, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
seeming to do so maliciously, upon the fact that the loop in
M. Kahn's plan would benefit the blast-furnaces at Bressuire.
There was nothing obviously bitter in what he said, but
amidst his pleasant sentences there was many a little stab
which could be felt only by the initiated. He became, however,
more cruel towards the end of his speech, when he
seemed to regret that 'the illustrious minister' should have
run the risk of compromising himself by countenancing an
undertaking whose financial prospects were a source of disquietude
to all men of experience. Enormous sums of money
would be wanted, he said, as well as the greatest integrity and
most perfect disinterestedness. Then, in conclusion, he gave
his mouth a twist and spoke in this fashion: 'That these
fears, however, are quite chimerical we can have no doubt,
when we see at the head of the undertaking a man whose
wealth and high commercial probity are so well known
throughout the department.'</p>

<p>A murmur of approval ran through the audience; though
a few people glanced at M. Kahn, who with pale lips was
endeavouring to smile. Rougon had listened with his eyes
half closed, as though he were inconvenienced by the brightness
of the light. When he opened them again they were
black and stern. His original intention had been to make
a very brief speech indeed; but he now felt that he had to
defend one of his own band. With three steps he reached
the edge of the tent, and there, with a sweeping gesture that
seemed to call upon all France to listen to him, he began:
'Gentlemen, let me in imagination overleap these hills which
surround us and embrace the whole empire at one glance,
and thus exalt the ceremony which has brought us together
by making it a festival of industrial and commercial labour.
At this very moment, while I am now addressing you, from
the north to the south of the country canals are being excavated,
railway lines are being laid down, mountains are being
tunnelled, bridges are being built——'</p>

<p>Perfect silence had fallen all around. Not a sound broke
upon the speaker's words save the rustling of the trees or the
grating of some river-lock in the distance. The firemen striving
to bear themselves as martially as the soldiers beneath the
hot sun, cast side-long glances at the minister, without turning
their necks. The spectators on the hill-side, however,
were taking their ease. Ladies had spread their handkerchiefs
on the ground and were sitting on them; and two gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
whom the sun was reaching, had just opened their wives'
parasols. And Rougon's voice gradually grew louder and
louder. He seemed ill at ease in that little hollow. It was as
if the narrow valley did not afford him sufficient space for his
gesticulations. As he threw his hands energetically in front
of him, it seemed as if he desired to sweep away all obstructions
and open out a wider horizon. Twice he gazed into the
air as if seeking space, but nothing met his eyes on the hill
tops save the gutted ruins of the windmills which were splitting
in the sun.</p>

<p>He had taken up M. Kahn's text and was enlarging upon
it. It was not, he said, the department of Deux-Sèvres alone
that was about to enter upon an era of wonderful prosperity,
but the whole of France, thanks to the branch line from
Niort to Angers. For ten minutes he recounted the innumerable
advantages which would rain down upon the
people. He even went so far as to allude to the hand of
God. Then he began to reply to what had been said by the
chief surveyor, though he in no way discussed it or even
referred to it. He simply said the direct opposite of what the
surveyor had said, dwelling for a long time upon M. Kahn's
devotion, and praising his great modesty and disinterestedness
and nobility of mind. The financial aspect of the matter, he
said, caused him no uneasiness whatever; and he smiled and
seemed to be sweeping up big piles of gold with a rapid
movement of his hands.</p>

<p>An outburst of cheering quite drowned his voice.</p>

<p>'One word in conclusion, gentlemen,' he said, after wiping
his lips with his handkerchief. That one word lasted for a
quarter of an hour. He was growing excited, and went
further than he had meant to do. Indeed, in his peroration,
while speaking of the grandeur of the reign, and extolling the
Emperor's great ability, he even hinted that his Majesty
would bestow his patronage in a special manner upon the
branch line from Niort to Angers. It was as if the undertaking
had become a State affair.</p>

<p>However, three great bursts of cheers rang out. A flight
of crows, skimming aloft across the cloudless sky, took fright
with much noisy croaking. Immediately the minister's
speech had finished, the Philharmonic Society had begun to
play again, a signal being given from the tent; while all the
ladies sprang up, anxious to miss nothing of the ceremony.
The guests were smiling around Rougon with delighted faces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
The mayor, the public prosecutor, and the colonel of the
seventy-eighth infantry were wagging their heads approvingly
while listening to the deputy, who expressed his admiration
of his excellency in tones which, although subdued, were yet
loud enough to reach the minister's ears. However, it was
the chief surveyor of bridges and highways who manifested
the greatest enthusiasm. He displayed an extraordinary
amount of obsequiousness, and seemed quite thunderstruck
by the great man's magnificent language.</p>

<p>'Would your excellency do me the honour to follow me?'
now asked M. Kahn, whose fat face was perspiring with
pleasure.</p>

<p>The concluding part of the ceremony was at hand. His
excellency was about to fire the first mine. Orders had just
been given to the gang of navvies in new blouses. The men
preceded the minister and M. Kahn into the cutting and drew
themselves up in two lines at the far end. Then a foreman
who held a piece of lighted rope presented it to Rougon. The
officials, who had remained in the tent, craned their heads
forward. Everyone waited anxiously. The Philharmonic
Society was still playing.</p>

<p>'Will it make very much noise?' the head-master's wife
inquired, with an uneasy smile, of one of the public prosecutor's
assessors.</p>

<p>'That depends upon the nature of the rock,' hastily interposed
the President of the Tribunal of Commerce, who at once
entered upon various mineralogical explanations.</p>

<p>'I shall stuff up my ears,' murmured the eldest of the
three daughters of the conservator of rivers and forests.</p>

<p>Rougon felt that he was looking very foolish, standing in
the midst of all these people with the burning rope in his
hand. Up above, on the hill crests, the ruined windmills
were creaking louder than ever in the warm sunlight. Then
he hastened to light the fuse, the end of which, lying between
two stones, was pointed out to him by the foreman. One of
the navvies immediately blew a long blast on a horn, and all
the gang hurried off, while M. Kahn hastily pulled his excellency
back into the tent, manifesting much anxious solicitude
for his safety.</p>

<p>'Well, why doesn't it go off?' stammered the registrar,
who was blinking nervously, and would very much have liked
to close his ears, as the ladies were doing.</p>

<p>The explosion did not take place for a couple of minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
It had been considered prudent to have a very long fuse. The
expectation of the company turned almost to anguish; every
eye was fixed upon the red rock; some spectators fancied
they could see it moving, and timid ones expressed a fear of
being struck by the fragments. At last there was a low reverberation,
and the rock split, while a number of fragments,
twice the size of a man's fist, shot up into the air amidst the
smoke. Then everybody went away; and on all sides one
could hear the same question repeated, 'Don't you smell the
powder?'</p>

<p>In the evening the prefect gave a dinner, which the
officials and functionaries attended. For the ball which
followed he had issued five hundred invitations. It was a
splendid affair. The great drawing-room was decorated with
evergreens; and in each corner a small chandelier had
been fixed, making with the central one five chandeliers
in all, whose tapers flooded the room with brilliant light.
Niort could remember no such scene of magnificence. The
light that streamed from the six windows quite illuminated the
Place de la Préfecture, where more than two thousand inquisitive
sight-seers had gathered together, straining their eyes in
their eagerness to catch a glimpse of the dancers. The orchestra
also could be so distinctly heard that children got up galops on
the footways. From nine o'clock the ladies were fanning
themselves, refreshments were being carried round, and
quadrilles were following upon waltzes and polkas. In ceremonious
fashion Du Poizat stood by the door, smilingly
receiving the late arrivals.</p>

<p>'Doesn't your excellency dance?' the head-master's wife
boldly asked of Rougon. She had just arrived, and was wearing
a dress of tarlatan, spangled with gold stars.</p>

<p>Rougon excused himself, with a smile. He was standing
in front of one of the windows, surrounded by a group of
guests, and, while joining in a conversation on the desirability
of a new land survey, he kept on glancing outside. In the
bright light which the candles cast upon the houses on the
opposite side of the square, he had just caught sight of
Madame Correur and Mademoiselle Herminie Billecoq at
one of the windows of the Hôtel de Paris. They were standing
there, leaning and watching the ball, as though they were
in a box at a theatre. Their faces glistened, and every now
and then their bare throats rippled with laughter as some
amusing incident attracted their notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>However, the head-master's wife had gone all round the
drawing-room, looking somewhat disconsolate, and never
heeding the admiration which her sweeping train excited
among the younger men. She was evidently looking for some
one, as she thus stepped smilingly and languidly along.</p>

<p>'Hasn't Monsieur le Commissaire central arrived?' she at
last asked Du Poizat, who was inquiring after her husband's
health. 'I promised him a waltz.'</p>

<p>'Oh, he's sure to come,' the prefect answered. 'I am
surprised that he is not here already. He had to go away on
official business to-day; but he told me that he would be back
by six o'clock.'</p>

<p>After the <i>déjeuner</i> at the prefecture, about noon, Gilquin
had set out from Niort on horseback to go and arrest notary
Martineau. Coulonges was some twelve miles away. He calculated
upon arriving there at two o'clock, and upon being able
to get away by four, or perhaps a little later, which would
leave him plenty of time to attend the banquet, to which he
had been invited. Consequently, he did not hurry his horse,
but jogged along, while reflecting that he would make the
running at the ball in the evening with that pretty blonde,
the head-master's wife, whose only fault in his eyes was that
she was rather too slim. When he reached Coulonges, he
dismounted at the Golden Lion, where a corporal and two
gendarmes ought to have been waiting for him. By arranging
matters in this way, he had anticipated that his arrival
would not be noticed; and he could hire a carriage, he
thought, and carry the notary off without any of the
neighbours being any the wiser. The gendarmes, however,
were not there. Gilquin waited for them till five o'clock,
swearing, and drinking grog, and looking at his watch every
quarter of an hour. He should never be able to get back to
Niort in time for the banquet, he muttered. He was just
having his horse saddled, when the corporal at last made his
appearance, followed by his two men. There had been some
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>'Well, well, don't waste time in apologising!' cried the
commissary angrily. 'We've got no time for that! It's
already a quarter-past five. Let us get hold of our man as
quickly as possible. We must be on our way back in another
ten minutes.'</p>

<p>Generally speaking, Gilquin was a good-natured individual.
He prided himself upon the urbanity with which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
discharged his official duties. That day he had even arranged
an elaborate scheme, by which he hoped to spare
Madame Correur's brother any violent emotion. It had been
his intention to enter the house alone, while the gendarmes
waited with the carriage near the garden-gate, in a little lane
which looked on to the open country. But his three hours'
waiting at the Golden Lion had so exasperated him that he
forgot all these fine precautions. He walked through the
village, and rang loudly at the street-door of the notary's
house. One of the gendarmes was posted at this door, and
the other was directed to go round and keep a watch on the
garden-wall. The corporal went in with the commissary.
Ten or a dozen scared villagers watched them from a
distance.</p>

<p>The servant who opened the door was seized with childish
terror at the sight of the uniforms, and rushed away, crying at
the top of her voice: 'Madame! Madame! Madame!'</p>

<p>A short plump woman, whose face maintained an expression
of perfect calm, came slowly down the staircase.</p>

<p>'Madame Martineau, I presume?' said Gilquin rapidly.
'I have a painful duty to perform, madame. I have come to
arrest your husband.'</p>

<p>Madame Martineau clasped her short hands, while her pale
lips began to quiver. But she uttered no cry. She remained
standing on the bottom step, blocking the way with her
skirts. Then she asked Gilquin to show her his warrant, and
required explanations, doing all she could to cause a delay.</p>

<p>'Be careful! He'll slip through our fingers if we don't
mind,' the corporal murmured in the commissary's ear.</p>

<p>Madame Martineau probably heard this remark, for she
looked at the two men with her calm eyes, and said: 'Come
upstairs, gentlemen.'</p>

<p>She went up in front of them and took them into a room,
in the middle of which stood M. Martineau in his dressing
gown. Upon hearing the servant's cries of alarm he had
risen from the arm-chair in which he spent most of his time.
He was very tall; his hands seemed quite dead; his face
was as pale as wax; and only his eyes—dark, soft, and yet
determined eyes—appeared to retain any life. Madame
Martineau pointed to him in silence.</p>

<p>'I regret to say, sir,' began Gilquin, 'that I have a
painful duty to perform.'</p>

<p>When he had explained his errand, the notary nodded but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
did not speak. A slight quiver, however, shook the dressing-gown
which covered his attenuated limbs. At last, with great
politeness, he replied: 'Very well, gentlemen, I will follow
you.'</p>

<p>Then he began to walk about the room, putting in order
several articles, which were lying on different pieces of
furniture. For instance, he moved a parcel of books to
another place. Then he asked his wife for a clean shirt. The
trembling which was affecting him had now become more
pronounced. Madeline Martineau, seeing him totter, followed
him with outstretched arms, ready to catch him should he
fall, just as one follows a little child.</p>

<p>'Come, sir, make haste!' repeated Gilquin.</p>

<p>The notary took another couple of turns round the room,
and then suddenly snatched at the air with his hands, and let
himself fall into an arm-chair, distorted and stiffened by
a paralytic seizure. At this his wife shed big silent tears.</p>

<p>Gilquin took out his watch. 'Confound it all!' he cried.
It was half-past five, and he felt that he must now relinquish
all hope of being back at Niort in time for the dinner at the
prefecture. It would take at least another half hour to get
this man into a carriage. He tried to console himself with the
thought that at any rate he would not miss the ball, and just
then he recollected that the head-master's wife had promised
him the first waltz.</p>

<p>'He's shamming,' the corporal now whispered to Gilquin.
'Shall I lift him on to his feet?' And without waiting for a
reply, he stepped up to the notary and advised him not to
attempt to deceive justice. Martineau, however, was as rigid
as a corpse; his eyes were closed and his lips pinched. Thereupon
the corporal lost his temper, and indulged in strong
language, till at last he laid his heavy hand on the collar of
the notary's dressing-gown. But at this Madame Martineau,
who had hitherto remained passive, energetically pushed him
aside, and planted herself in front of her husband, clenching
her fists with an air of devoted resolution.</p>

<p>'He's shamming, I tell you!' the corporal repeated.</p>

<p>Gilquin shrugged his shoulders. He had made up his
mind to carry the notary off whether he were dead or alive.
'Send one of your men to get the carriage from the Golden
Lion,' he said to the corporal. 'I have spoken to the landlord
about one.'</p>

<p>When the corporal had left the room, Gilquin stepped up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
to the window, and looked complacently at the apricot trees
which were blossoming in the garden. He was growing quite
absorbed in his thoughts, when he felt a touch upon his
shoulder. Madame Martineau stood behind him. Her cheeks
were quite dry now, and she spoke in a calm steady voice.
'You mean a carriage for yourself, don't you?' she asked.
'You surely can't think of dragging my husband to Niort, in
his present state.'</p>

<p>'I have a painful duty to perform, madame—' Gilquin
began for the third time.</p>

<p>'But it is a crime! You will kill him!' Madame Martineau
interrupted. 'You have not been ordered to kill him, have
you?'</p>

<p>'I am acting under orders,' Gilquin replied in a rougher
tone, for he wished to curtail the entreaties which he thought
were coming.</p>

<p>But a gleam of desperate anger flashed across Madame
Martineau's plump face, and her eyes glanced round the room,
as though she were trying to discover some possible means of
saving her husband. However, she calmed herself by an effort,
and reverted to her previous demeanour, like a strong-minded
woman who realises that tears can be of no service.</p>

<p>'God will punish you, sir,' she quietly said, after a short
pause, during which she had kept her eyes fixed on Gilquin.</p>

<p>Then, without a tear or entreaty she turned to lean over
the chair in which her husband lay dying. Gilquin had
merely smiled.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the corporal, who had gone in person
to the Golden Lion, came back to say that the landlord asserted
he had not got a vehicle of any sort. The arrest of the notary,
who was extremely popular in the neighbourhood, must have
been noised abroad, and the landlord was doubtless concealing
his conveyances; for two hours previously, when the commissary
had questioned him on the subject, he had promised
to let him have an old brougham which he let out for drives
in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>'Go and search the inn!' cried Gilquin, enraged by this
fresh obstacle. 'Search every house in the village! Do they
think they will have a game with us? And be quick, I have
an engagement to keep, and have no time to spare. I give
you a quarter of an hour.'</p>

<p>The corporal hurried off again, taking his men with him;
and each went in a different direction. Three-quarters of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
hour passed, however, and then another quarter, and then
another. At the end of an hour and a half one of the
gendarmes returned with a very long face. All his searching
had been futile. Gilquin, who had grown feverishly excited,
kept rushing about and looking out of the window into the
twilight. The ball would certainly begin without him, he
reflected, and the head-master's wife would consider him
guilty of great discourtesy. Each time that he went past the
notary's chair he almost choked with anger. Never had any
criminal caused him so much trouble as that man who lay
there perfectly motionless, becoming ever paler and colder.</p>

<p>It was past seven o'clock when the corporal returned with
a beaming countenance. He had at last discovered the landlord's
old brougham, concealed in a shed half a mile from the
village. The horse was harnessed and between the shafts, and
it was the animal's snorting which had enabled him to discover
it. However, when the vehicle was at the door, it became
necessary to dress M. Martineau, and this took a very long
time. His wife very slowly and deliberately put him on some
clean white stockings and a clean white shirt. Then she
dressed him in black from head to foot; black trousers, frock-coat
and waistcoat. She would not allow the gendarmes to
render her the slightest assistance. The notary quietly yielded
to her touch. A lamp had been lighted, and Gilquin stood
tapping his hands together impatiently, while the corporal
remained perfectly still, his three-cornered hat casting a huge
shadow upon the ceiling.</p>

<p>'Come, come, haven't you done now?' Gilquin repeated.</p>

<p>For the last five minutes Madame Martineau had been
searching in a drawer. At last she produced a pair of black
gloves which she put into her husband's pocket. 'I hope, sir,'
she said, 'that you will allow me to come in the carriage.
I should much like to go with my husband.'</p>

<p>'That is impossible,' replied Gilquin roughly.</p>

<p>She restrained herself instead of pressing her request.
'At any rate,' she said, 'you will allow me to follow him?'</p>

<p>'The roads are free to every one,' answered the commissary,
'but you won't be able to get a vehicle, as there are
none in the neighbourhood.'</p>

<p>At this Madame Martineau shrugged her shoulders slightly,
and left the room to give an order. Ten minutes afterwards
a gig drew up in front of the door, behind the brougham. It
was now necessary to get the notary downstairs. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
gendarmes carried him, while his wife supported his head.
Whenever the dying man uttered the slightest groan, Madame
Martineau imperiously ordered the gendarmes to stop, which
they did, notwithstanding the angry glances of the commissary.
In this way they halted for a moment on each successive
step. The notary looked like a corpse in their arms,
and he was quite unconscious when they seated him in the
carriage.</p>

<p>'Half-past eight!' exclaimed Gilquin angrily, looking at
his watch for the last time. 'Confound it all! I shall never
get there!'</p>

<p>There was no doubt about that. He would be fortunate
if he arrived before the ball was half over. However, he
sprang on his horse with an oath and ordered the coachman
to drive as fast as he could. The brougham led the way, the
gendarmes riding at each side of it; then, a few yards behind,
followed the commissary, and the corporal, and last of all came
the gig with Madame Martineau. The night air was very sharp.
The little <i>cortège</i> passed over the long grey road through all the
sleeping country, accompanied by a rumbling of wheels and
the monotonous footfalls of the horses. Not a word was
spoken during the journey. Gilquin was thinking of what he
should say when he met the head-master's wife. Every now
and then, however, Madame Martineau sprang to her feet in
the gig, fancying that she heard a death-rattle, but she could
scarcely distinguish the brougham as it rolled on before her
through the black night.</p>

<p>It was half-past ten when they reached Niort. The commissary,
to avoid passing through the town, directed the
driver of the brougham to go round by the ramparts. When
they reached the gaol, they had to ring loudly. As soon as
the gatekeeper saw the white, stiffened prisoner they were
bringing him, he went off to rouse the governor. The latter,
who was not very well, soon made his appearance in his
slippers. And when he saw Martineau, he became quite
angry, and absolutely refused to receive a man in such a condition.
Did they take the gaol for an hospital? he asked
them.</p>

<p>'The man has been arrested, and what do you expect us
to do with him?' cried Gilquin, losing his temper at this
fresh impediment.</p>

<p>'Whatever you like, monsieur le commissaire, except bring
him here,' replied the governor. 'I again tell you that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
refuse to receive him. I won't take such a responsibility upon
myself.'</p>

<p>Madame Martineau had profited by this discussion to get
into the brougham with her husband. And she now proposed
that he should be taken to the hotel.</p>

<p>'Very well, to the hotel or the devil, or wherever you
like!' cried Gilquin. 'I've had quite enough of him! Take
him along!'</p>

<p>He conformed sufficiently to his duty, however, to accompany
the notary to the Hôtel de Paris, which Madame Martineau
herself fixed upon. The Place de la Préfecture was
now becoming empty, and only some children were left playing
on the footways; while the middle-class couples slowly
disappeared into the darkness of the neighbouring streets.
However, the bright glow from the six windows of the prefecture
still made the square almost as light as day. The
band's brass instruments were blaring, and the ladies' bare
shoulders and curled chignons could be seen between the open
curtains, circling round the room. As the notary was being
carried to the first floor, Gilquin raised his head and caught
sight of Madame Correur and Mademoiselle Billecoq, who
were still gazing at the festivities. The elder lady, however,
must have noticed her brother, for, leaning out so far
as to risk a fall, she made an energetic sign to Gilquin to
come upstairs. He did so.</p>

<p>Towards midnight the ball at the prefecture reached its
zenith. The doors of the dining-room, where a cold supper
had been laid, had just been thrown open. The ladies, with
hot, flushed faces, fanned themselves as they stood up and ate,
amidst a deal of gay laughter. Others were still dancing,
unwilling to lose a single quadrille, and contenting themselves
with glasses of syrup and water, which gentlemen brought to
them. The room was full of a hazy glitter of women's hair
and skirts and braceleted arms. There seemed to be too
much gold, too much music, and too much heat; and Rougon,
who felt half suffocated, was glad indeed to make his escape on
being discreetly summoned by Du Poizat.</p>

<p>Madame Correur and Mademoiselle Herminie Billecoq
were waiting for him in the small adjoining salon where he
had seen them on the previous evening. They were both
crying bitterly.</p>

<p>'My poor brother! my poor Martineau!' stammered
Madame Correur, while wiping her tears away with her handkerchief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
'Ah! I felt sure that you could do nothing for
him. Oh, why couldn't you have saved him?'</p>

<p>Rougon was going to say something, but she would not
give him time.</p>

<p>'He has been arrested to-day,' she continued. 'I have
just seen him. Oh dear! oh dear!'</p>

<p>'Don't distress yourself,' replied Rougon, at last. 'The
matter shall be looked into, and I hope that we shall be able
to obtain his release.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Madame Correur ceased dabbing her eyes with
her handkerchief. She looked at Rougon and exclaimed in
her natural voice: 'But he is dead!' Then again she relapsed
into a disconsolate tone and buried her face in her
handkerchief. 'Oh dear! Oh dear! my poor, poor Martineau!'</p>

<p>Dead! A sudden tremor passed through Rougon's body.
He could not find a word to say. For the first time he
became conscious of a pit before him, a dark gloomy pit into
which he was being gradually driven. To think that the man
was dead! He had never intended that anything of that kind
should happen. Things had gone too far.</p>

<p>'Alas! yes, the poor dear man is dead,' said Mademoiselle
Herminie Billecoq, with a deep, long-drawn sigh. 'It seems
that they refused to receive him at the gaol. Then, when we
saw him arriving at the hotel in such a pitiable condition,
madame went down and insisted upon being admitted, saying
that she was his sister. A sister may surely claim to receive
her brother's last breath. That is what I said to that hussy
of a Madame Martineau, who threatened to turn us out of the
room. But we forced her to let us remain by the bedside.
<i>Mon Dieu</i>! it was soon all over. The death agony only lasted
an hour. The poor man was lying on the bed dressed all in
black. Anyone would have thought that he was a notary just
going to a marriage. And he died out just like a candle-flame,
with a little twist of his face. He couldn't have had
much pain.'</p>

<p>'And then—would you believe it?—Madame Martineau
actually tried to pick a quarrel with me,' cried Madame
Correur. 'I don't know what she was driving at, but she
spoke about my brother's property, and accused me of having
given him the last stroke. I said to her, "If I had been there,
madame, I would never have allowed him to be taken away, I
would have let the gendarmes hew me in pieces sooner!" And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
they <i>should</i> have hewn me in pieces sooner! I told you so,
didn't I, Herminie?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, indeed,' said the tall girl.</p>

<p>'Well, I know my tears won't bring him to life again,'
continued Madame Correur; 'but I'm crying because I can't
help it. Oh, my poor Martineau!'</p>

<p>Rougon felt very ill at ease. He drew back his hands
which Madame Correur had grasped. Still he could not think
of anything to say, shocked as he was by the story of this
death which seemed so abominable to him.</p>

<p>'Look!' exclaimed Herminie, who was standing in front
of the window, 'you can see the room from here in this bright
light. It is the third window to the left, on the first floor.
There is a light behind the curtains.'</p>

<p>However, Rougon dismissed them, while Madame Correur
in return apologised for having troubled him, calling him her
friend, and saying that her first impulse had been to come and
tell him the fatal news.</p>

<p>'It is a very annoying business,' Rougon whispered to Du
Poizat, when he returned to the ball-room, with his face still
pale.</p>

<p>'It is all that idiot Gilquin's doing!' replied the prefect,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>The ball was still going on merrily. In the dining-room,
a part of which could be seen through the open door, the
mayor's assessor was stuffing the three daughters of the conservator
of rivers and forests with sweetmeats; while the
colonel of the seventy-eighth was drinking punch and listening
attentively to the cutting remarks of the chief surveyor of
bridges and highways, who was munching sugared almonds.
M. Kahn, near the door, was repeating to the President of the
Civil Tribunal the speech which he had delivered in the
afternoon on the advantages of the new railway line; and
round them stood a group of grave-faced men, the comptroller
of taxes, the two justices of the peace, and the delegates from
the consultative Chamber of Agriculture and the Statistical
Society, all with gaping mouths. Then around the ball-room,
in the glow of the chandeliers, the dancers revolved to the
music of a waltz, which the band blared forth. The son of
the receiver-general was dancing with the mayor's sister; one
of the public prosecutor's assessors was with a girl in blue;
and the other with a girl in pink. But one couple excited
particular admiration, that composed of the commissary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
police and the head-master's wife, who slowly revolved in a
close embrace. Gilquin had hurried off to array himself
irreproachably in black dress-coat, patent-leather boots and
white gloves, and the beautiful blonde, having forgiven him for
his tardy arrival, was now nestling against his shoulder, with
languishing eyes. Gilquin threw his chest forward, and brought
the motion of his hips into strong prominence, a vulgarism
which seemed to delight the spectators as if it had been something
very tasteful. And as the pair revolved round the room
they all but came into collision with Rougon, who had to step
back to the very wall to let them pass him in a whirling cloud
of tarlatan, spangled with golden stars.</p>



<hr class="chap">
<h3><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a></h3>

<h3>IN COUNCIL AT ST. CLOUD</h3>


<p>Rougon had at last succeeded in obtaining the portfolio of
Agriculture and Commerce for Delestang. One morning,
early in May, he went to the Rue du Colisée to fetch his new
colleague, for there was to be a ministerial council at Saint
Cloud, where the Court had just gone to reside.</p>

<p>'What! are you coming with us?' Rougon exclaimed in
surprise, as he saw Clorinde taking her place in the landau
which was standing in front of the steps.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she answered, with a laugh; 'yes, I'm going to the
council, too.' Then, when she had arranged the flounces of her
long gown of pale cherry-coloured silk, she added, more seriously:
'I have an appointment with the Empress. I am treasurer
of a society for assisting young work-girls in which she is
interested.'</p>

<p>In their turn the two men took their places. Delestang
sat down by his wife's side. He had with him a brown
morocco portfolio, which he kept upon his knees. Rougon sat
opposite Clorinde, and carried nothing. It was nearly half-past
nine, and the council was fixed for ten, so the coachman
was ordered to drive as quickly as he could. To make a short
cut, therefore, he went along the Rue Marbeuf, and thence
through the Chaillot district, which the demolishers were
already ripping up. There were deserted streets fringed with
gardens and wooden shanties, steep winding passages and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
little neglected squares, planted with sickly-looking trees. It
was a strange patch of the great city, a medley of villas and
cabins, basking on a hill-side in the bright morning sunshine.</p>

<p>'How hideous it is here!' said Clorinde, lying back in the
landau.</p>

<p>Then, half-turning, she glanced at her husband, at first
gravely, but afterwards, as though she could not help it, she
began to smile. Delestang, with his frock coat buttoned
round him, was sitting primly erect. His handsome, thoughtful
face, and premature baldness, which gave an appearance
of great height to his brow, attracted the attention of the
passers-by. Clorinde noticed that no one looked at Rougon,
whose heavy face seemed to be asleep. Presently, in a sort
of maternal manner, she pulled her husband's left wristband
forward a little, as it had slipped back inside his sleeve.</p>

<p>'What were you doing last night?' she then asked of the
great man, as she saw him yawning behind his fingers.</p>

<p>'I was working very late,' he said. 'There were a lot of
tiresome things to see to.'</p>

<p>There was another pause, and Clorinde began to study
Rougon. He yielded unresistingly to the slight jolting of the
carriage. His frock-coat was strained out of shape by his
broad shoulders, and his hat was badly brushed, and bore
marks of old rain stains. He reminded Clorinde of a jobber
from whom she had bought a horse a month previously, and
a smile, with which was mingled a touch of contempt,
appeared upon her lips.</p>

<p>'Well?' said Rougon, at last, feeling somewhat annoyed
by Clorinde's prolonged scrutiny.</p>

<p>'Well,' she replied, 'I'm looking at you. It isn't forbidden
to do so, is it? You're not afraid that I shall eat you, are
you?'</p>

<p>She spoke these last words with a provoking air, showing
her white teeth. Rougon, however, began to joke. 'I'm too
big for that,' he said; 'you wouldn't be able to get me down.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know that, if I were very hungry,' she gravely
answered, after apparently considering her appetite.</p>

<p>The landau was now reaching the Porte de la Muette.
Here, on emerging from the narrow streets of the Chaillot
district, the horizon suddenly spread out over the light verdure
of the Bois de Boulogne. It was a lovely morning, and the
distant turf was steeped in golden light, while the young
leaves on the trees rustled gently in the warm air. They left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the deer-park on their right, and took the gravelled avenue
leading to Saint Cloud. The landau now rolled on without a
jolt, as lightly and softly as a sledge gliding through the snow.</p>

<p>'How nasty those streets were!' said Clorinde, as she
lolled back. 'Well, we can breathe here, and talk. Have you
any news of our friend Du Poizat?'</p>

<p>'Yes, he's very well,' Rougon replied.</p>

<p>'And does he still like his department?'</p>

<p>Rougon made a vague gesture, not wishing to give her
any definite reply. She was aware, however, that the prefect
of Deux-Sèvres was becoming a source of some trouble to
him, on account of the severity of his administration. Without
pressing the point she next began to talk of M. Kahn,
and Madame Correur, and finally, with a touch of mischievous
curiosity, she asked Rougon about his visit to Niort. Then
she broke off to say: 'By the way, I met Colonel Jobelin and
his cousin Monsieur Bouchard yesterday. We talked about
you. Yes, we talked about you.'</p>

<p>Rougon still kept silent, with his shoulders bowed. To
rouse him, Clorinde began to speak of the past. 'Do you
remember our pleasant little evenings in the Rue Marbeuf?'
she inquired. 'Now you are so busy that we can't get near
you. Your friends complain about it. They say that you are
forgetting them. I'm always quite frank, you know, and
conceal nothing. Well, to tell the truth, they say that you
are deserting them, my dear fellow.'</p>

<p>At this moment, the carriage, which had just passed
between the two lakes, encountered a brougham on its way
back to Paris, and through the window of the latter vehicle
a glimpse was caught of a sulky-looking face, which hastily
withdrew, as if to avoid the necessity of bowing.</p>

<p>'Why, it's your brother-in-law!' exclaimed Clorinde.</p>

<p>'Yes, he's not very well,' replied Rougon, with a smile.
'His doctor has ordered him to take morning drives.'</p>

<p>Then he suddenly threw off his reserve, and began to talk
freely, while the landau sped along beneath the tall trees of
the gently curving avenue.</p>

<p>'What would you have?' said he. 'I can't give them
the moon, however much they may cry for it! Take Beulin-d'Orchère,
for instance, his dream is to be Minister of Justice.
I have tried to effect the impossible, and have sounded the
Emperor on the subject; but I can't get any answer. I fancy,
however, that the Emperor feels afraid of him. Well, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
isn't my fault, is it? Beulin-d'Orchère is first President of
the Appeal Court. That really ought to satisfy him for the
present. And yet, you see, he actually avoids bowing to me.
He's a fool!'</p>

<p>Clorinde had lowered her eyes, and her fingers were playing
with the tassel of her sun-shade. She now made no
attempt to speak, but let Rougon talk on freely.</p>

<p>'The others,' said he, 'are almost as unreasonable. If the
colonel and Bouchard complain of me, they do wrong, for I
have already done too much for them. I say that for all my
friends. I've got a dozen mill-stones about my neck! Till
they've got the very skin off my body they won't be satisfied!'
He paused for a moment, and then resumed with a good-natured
laugh: 'Well, well, if they really needed something
more, I would give it to them. When a man has once opened
his hands it is impossible for him to shut them again. In
spite of all the unkind things my friends say of me, I
spend my time in asking favours of all sorts for them.'</p>

<p>Then he touched Clorinde's knee to force her to look at
him.</p>

<p>'Well, now, about yourself!' he continued. 'I am going
to talk to the Emperor this morning. Is there anything that
I can ask for you?'</p>

<p>'No, thank you,' she answered drily. And as he still
persisted in his offers, she grew a little vexed, and accused
him of reproaching herself and her husband with the few
services he had already rendered them. They would not
trouble him in future, said she. 'I manage my affairs myself
now,' she added. 'I'm big enough to get on by myself, am
I not?'</p>

<p>Meantime the carriage had emerged from the Bois. It
was now passing through Boulogne amid the clatter of several
heavy carts, which were jolting along the high street.
Delestang had been silent ever since the start, keeping his
hands upon his morocco portfolio, and apparently absorbed in
momentous thoughts. However, he now bent forward and
called to Rougon amidst the uproar: 'Do you think that his
Majesty will keep us to <i>déjeuner</i>?'</p>

<p>Rougon made a gesture expressive of doubt. Then he
exclaimed: 'We do generally have <i>déjeuner</i> at the palace
when the council is a long one.'</p>

<p>Delestang fell back into his corner, and once more appeared
to be absorbed in a very serious reverie. Presently he bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
forward again, to ask: 'Will there be much business before
the council this morning?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps so,' answered Rougon. 'But one can never
tell beforehand. Several of our colleagues, I fancy, are going
to report on certain important matters. For my own part,
at any rate, I intend to raise the question of that book about
which I am in dispute with the Licensing Committee.'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>'What book is that?' asked Clorinde eagerly.</p>

<p>'Oh! an idiotic publication; one of those volumes which
are got up for circulation amongst the peasantry. It is
called "Friend Jacques's Evening Chats." It is a mixture of
socialism, witchcraft, and agriculture; and there's even a
chapter on the advantages of trades' unions. Briefly, it is a
very dangerous book!'</p>

<p>The young woman, whose curiosity did not seem quite
satisfied, turned to her husband as if to question him.</p>

<p>'You are over severe, Rougon,' said Delestang. 'I have
looked at the book, and have found some good matter in it.
The chapter on the advantages accruing from the association
of labour is very good, I think. I shall be surprised if the
Emperor condemns the ideas contained in it.'</p>

<p>Rougon was about to reply hotly, and opened his arms
with a gesture of protest. But he suddenly restrained himself,
as though he did not want to discuss the matter further.
And instead of speaking, he glanced at the country through
which they were passing. The landau was now half-way
across the bridge of Saint Cloud. Down below, the pale blue
river was flowing sleepily, shimmering in the sunshine; the
rows of trees along the banks being vigorously reflected in the
water. Above and below steam climbed the sky, so whitened
by the limpidity of springtide that scarcely a touch of blue
could be seen.</p>

<p>When the carriage stopped in the courtyard of the château
Rougon alighted first and offered his hand to Clorinde. But
the young woman would not avail herself of his proffered
support; she sprang lightly to the ground, and as he remained
there still holding out his arm for her acceptance, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
gently tapped his fingers with her parasol, saying: 'Didn't
I tell you that I was big enough to manage by myself,
now?'</p>

<p>She seemed to have lost all her old respect for her master's
huge hands which she had so often held with disciple-like
submission so as to drain away a little of their strength.
Doubtless she now fancied that she had weakened him sufficiently,
for she no longer displayed as of yore any adorable
cajolery. She, in her turn, had acquired influence, and was
becoming a power. When Delestang had got out of the
carriage, she allowed Rougon to go on before them, and whispered
in her husband's ear: 'I hope you won't try to prevent
him from getting into a tangle with his "Friend Jacques." It
will give you a good opportunity of not always appearing to
say the very same as he does.'</p>

<p>In the entrance-hall, before leaving Delestang, Clorinde
gave him a careful glance, and was worried to see one of the
buttons of his coat hanging a little loosely. Then, while an
usher went to inform the Empress of her arrival, she smilingly
watched Rougon and her husband take themselves off.</p>

<p>The ministerial council was held in a room near the
Emperor's private study. In the centre stood a large cloth-covered
table surrounded by a dozen arm-chairs. The high
windows admitted a bright light from the terrace of the
château. When Rougon and Delestang entered the room,
they found all their colleagues already assembled there, with
the exception of the Minister for Public Works and the Naval
and Colonial Minister, who were on leave of absence. The
Emperor had not yet made his appearance, and for ten
minutes or so the ministers chatted together, standing by the
windows and about the table. Two of them had scowling
faces, and so cordially detested each other that they never
exchanged a word, but all the rest were talking amicably
and easily, till serious matters should demand their attention.
Paris was just then much interested in an embassy
from the extreme east, the members of which wore fantastic
costumes, and indulged in the most extraordinary modes of
salutation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs related a visit
which he had paid to the chief of this embassy on the previous
evening; and while speaking with due regard for his
position as head of the diplomatic service, he contrived to
indulge in some light sarcasm at the envoy's expense. Then
the conversation turned upon more frivolous matters, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Minister of State<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> furnished some particulars respecting the
condition of a ballet girl of the opera-house who had narrowly
escaped breaking her leg. However, amidst all this apparent
unrestraint the ministers remained alert and distrustful of one
another, wording certain of their sentences with extreme
care, recalling at times half-uttered words, keeping a watchful
look-out even as they smiled, and suddenly becoming serious
as soon as they noticed that they were being observed.</p>

<p>'Then it was a mere sprain?' said Delestang, who took a
great interest in the ladies of the ballet.</p>

<p>'Yes, a sprain,' replied the Minister of State. 'The
poor girl will simply have to keep her room for a fortnight.
However, she feels very much ashamed of herself for having
fallen.'</p>

<p>A slight stir now caused the ministers to turn, and they all
bowed. The Emperor had just entered the room. He stood
for a moment leaning upon the back of his arm-chair. Then,
in his low deliberate voice, he asked: 'Is she better?'</p>

<p>'Much better, sire,' replied the minister, bowing again.
'I heard about her this morning.'</p>

<p>At a sign from the Emperor, the members of the council
took their seats round the table. There were nine of them.
Some of them spread out papers, while the others sat back in
their chairs and began to examine their nails. There was
silence for a while. The Emperor seemed unwell; and with
lifeless face he slowly twisted the waxed ends of his long
moustache. Then, as no one spoke, he appeared to recollect
something and remarked: 'Gentlemen, the session of the
Corps Législatif is about to end——'</p>

<p>The budget, which the Chamber had just voted in five
days, was the first subject which engaged the attention of the
council. The Minister of Finance mentioned the desires
which the reporter of the Chamber had expressed. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
first time, indeed, the Chamber had indulged in criticism, and its
reporter had asked that the sinking fund regulations might
be properly carried out, and that the government would in
future content itself with the supplies as voted, without constantly
applying for supplementary credits. Moreover, some
members of the Chamber had complained of the little weight
which was attached to their observations by the Council of
State, and one of them had even gone so far as to claim for
the Corps Législatif the right to prepare the budget.</p>

<p>'In my opinion,' said the Finance Minister, concluding
his remarks, 'there is no ground whatever for such claims.
The government always observes the greatest desire for
economy in preparing its budgets, and so true is this that
the Committee of the Chamber had no end of trouble to effect
a paltry saving of a couple of millions of francs. Still, I
think it would perhaps be advisable to postpone the application
for three supplementary votes of credit which we contemplated
making. A transfer of funds will provide us with
the necessary money for the time being, and matters can be
put straight later on.'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor nodded assent. However, he hardly seemed
to be listening to what was said. There was a blank, listless
look about his eyes, as he sat gazing at the bright light which
was streaming through the middle window in front of him.
There came another interval of silence. All the ministers
followed the Emperor in nodding their approval, and for a
moment or two only a slight rustling could be heard. The
Minister of Justice and Keeper of the Seals was turning over
some leaves of manuscript. At last when he had consulted
his colleagues with a glance, he began: 'Sire, I have brought
with me a memorandum relating to the creation of a new
nobility. As yet it consists merely of some rough notes,
which I thought it would be advisable to put before the
council before proceeding any further in the matter, in order
that I may profit by any hint——'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes; read it,' interrupted the Emperor. 'You are
quite right.'</p>

<p>Then he turned so as to look at the minister while the
latter read the memorandum. He seemed more animated
now; a yellow light had come into his grey eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>The Court was at that time extremely interested in this
scheme for a new nobility. The government had begun by
submitting to the Corps Législatif a bill which punished with
fine and imprisonment anyone who might assume any title of
nobility without being entitled to do so. It was a question of
giving official sanction to the old titles, and of thus preparing
the way for new ones. However, this bill had given rise to a
heated discussion in the Chamber. Some deputies, though
enthusiastically devoted to the empire, had protested that a
nobility could not exist in a democratic state; and, when a
division was taken, twenty-three votes had been given against
the bill. The Emperor, however, still clung to his dream;
and he himself had suggested some very comprehensive ideas
to the Minister of Justice.</p>

<p>The memorandum commenced by some historical references.
Then the projected scheme was detailed at length.
Titles were to be conferred for different kinds of public service,
so as to make the new honours accessible to all deserving
citizens, a democratic arrangement which seemed to fill the
minister with great enthusiasm. Then a draft of the proposed
decree was set out, and when the minister came to the
second clause of it he raised his voice and read on very
slowly: 'The title of Count shall be conferred upon the following
persons after five years' service in their respective
functions or dignities, or after we may have bestowed upon
them the grand cross of the Legion of Honour: namely, our
ministers and the members of our Privy Council, the cardinals,
marshals, admirals, senators, and ambassadors, and such
of the generals of division as shall have held a chief command
in the field.'</p>

<p>The minister paused for a moment, and cast a questioning
glance at the Emperor as if to ask whether he had omitted
anyone. His Majesty reflected, with his head slightly inclined
towards his left shoulder.</p>

<p>'I think we must include the Presidents of the Corps
Législatif and the Council of State,' he said, after a pause.</p>

<p>The Minister of Justice nodded approbation, and hastily
made a note on the margin of his manuscript. Just as he
was about to resume his reading, he was interrupted by the
Minister for Public Education and Worship, who wanted to
call attention to an omission.</p>

<p>'The archbishops——' he began.</p>

<p>'Excuse me,' interrupted the Minister of Justice drily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
'the archbishops are to be merely barons. Let me read the
whole of the decree.'</p>

<p>However, his papers had got mixed, and he spent some
time in looking for the next leaf. Rougon, who sat there with
his elbows spread out and his thick neck sinking between his
broad peasant shoulders, was faintly smiling; and, as he
turned round, he caught sight of his neighbour, the Minister
of State, the last scion of an old Norman family, likewise
indulging in a quiet smile of contempt. A significant glance
passed between them. The parvenu and the nobleman were
evidently of the same way of thinking.</p>

<p>'Ah, here it is!' exclaimed the Minister of Justice at last.
'Clause III. The title of baron shall be conferred, firstly,
upon such members of the Corps Législatif as shall have been
honoured three times with the confidence of their fellow-citizens;
secondly, upon members of the Council of State of
eight years' standing; thirdly, upon the first president and
the public prosecutor of the Supreme Court, upon the first
president and public prosecutor of the Exchequer Court, upon
the generals of division and vice admirals, upon the archbishops
and ministers-plenipotentiary, after five years' service
in their respective offices, or if they have attained the rank of
commander in the Legion of Honour——'</p>

<p>And so the minister read on. The first presidents and
public prosecutors of the appeal courts, the generals of
brigade and rear-admirals, the bishops, and even the mayors
of the chief cities of first-class prefectures, were in their turn
all to be made barons, but on condition that they had served
in their respective offices for ten years.</p>

<p>'Then everybody will be a baron,' murmured Rougon.</p>

<p>At this some of his colleagues, who affected to consider
him a very ill-bred man, assumed grave expressions, so as to
make him understand that they thought his remark in very
bad taste. The Emperor, however, did not seem to have
heard.</p>

<p>'Well, gentlemen, what do you think of the scheme?' his
Majesty asked, when the keeper of the seals had finished his
perusal.</p>

<p>They all hesitated, waiting as it were for a more direct
question.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Rougon,' resumed the Emperor, 'what is your
opinion?'</p>

<p>'Well, sire,' replied the Minister of the Interior, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
quiet smile, 'I cannot say that I think very favourably of it.
It is exposed to the greatest of all dangers, that is to say, to
ridicule. I am afraid that all those barons will merely raise
a laugh. I say nothing about more serious matters, such as
the sentiment of equality which is so much in the ascendant
at the present time, or the vanity which such a system would
tend to develop——'</p>

<p>But when he had got thus far he was interrupted by the
Minister of Justice, who seemed greatly put out, and began to
defend himself as though a personal attack had been made
upon him. He said that he was a middle-class man himself,
and the son of a middle-class father, and was quite incapable of
attempting anything to impair the principles of equality held
by modern society. The new nobility was going to be a
'democratic nobility,' and this expression 'democratic nobility'
seemed to convey his idea so perfectly that he repeated
it several times over. Then Rougon briefly replied, still
smiling and unruffled. But the Minister of Justice, a little
lean, dark man, at last began to indulge in somewhat offensive
personalities. The Emperor meantime held himself aloof
from the dispute, and with a slight swaying of the shoulders,
again gazed at the sunlight streaming through the window in
front of him. However, when the voices of the others finally
grew so loud as to interfere with his sense of dignity, he murmured:
'Gentlemen, gentlemen.' And after a pause, he
added: 'Monsieur Rougon is perhaps right. The scheme is
not quite ripe yet. We shall have to consider if it cannot
be put upon another basis. We can see to that later on.'</p>

<p>Then the council took some minor matters in hand. The
newspaper <i>Le Siècle</i> became the subject of a deal of talk, for
it had just published an article which had given great offence
at Court. A week never passed without those about the
Emperor entreating him to suppress this journal, which was
the only Republican organ still in existence. His Majesty,
however, was personally inclined to be indulgent towards the
press, and often amused himself, in the secrecy of his study,
by writing long articles in reply to the attacks which were
made upon his government. An unacknowledged dream of
his was to have a newspaper of his own, in which he might publish
manifestoes and engage in polemical discussions. However,
he that day decided that a warning should be addressed
to the <i>Siècle</i>.</p>

<p>Their excellencies now thought that the council was over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
as was evident from the manner in which they sat on the very
edges of their chairs. Indeed, the Minister for War, a general
who looked very much bored, and who had not spoken a word
during the whole sitting, had already taken his gloves from
his pocket, when Rougon leant heavily on the table.</p>

<p>'Sire,' he said, 'I desire to speak to the council of a conflict
which has arisen between the licensing committee and
myself with respect to a book which has been presented for
authorisation.'</p>

<p>The other ministers thereupon ensconced themselves in
their chairs again. The Emperor turned towards Rougon
and with a nod authorised him to continue.</p>

<p>Rougon then entered into details. He no longer smiled,
his good-natured expression had quite vanished. He leant
over the table, and, sweeping the cloth as it were with a
regular mechanical movement of his right hand, he stated
that he had determined to preside at one of the recent meetings
of the committee in order to stimulate the zeal of its
members. 'I pointed out to them,' said he, 'the views of the
government as to the improvements it was desirable for them
to effect in the important branch of the public service with
which they are entrusted. The <i>colportage</i> system,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> I told them,
would be a source of grave danger if it were allowed to become
a weapon in the hands of the revolutionists, and should prove
a means of reviving political discussions and ill-will. So
it is the duty of the committee, I said, to reject all publications
which might foment afresh such passions as are unsuited
to the present time. It ought, on the other hand, to encourage
those healthy works which teach the worship of God,
the love of one's country, and gratitude to one's Sovereign.'</p>

<p>The other ministers, although very cross at being thus
detained in council, felt constrained to bow approvingly on
hearing these last words.</p>

<p>'The number of pernicious books increases every day,'
continued Rougon. 'They form a rising flood against which
we cannot take sufficiently energetic steps for protecting our
country. Out of every dozen books that are published, eleven
and a half are only fit to be thrown into the fire. That is the
average. Never before have wicked sentiments, subversive
theories, and anti-social monstrosities of all kinds, found so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
many exponents. I am occasionally compelled to read certain
publications; well, I tell you——'</p>

<p>At this moment the Minister for Public Education ventured
on an interruption. 'Novels,' he began.</p>

<p>'I never read novels,' retorted Rougon drily.</p>

<p>His colleague made a gesture of virtuous protest, and
rolled his eyes in a shocked sort of way, as though he also
repudiated all reading of novels. Then he explained himself,
saying: 'I merely wanted to remark that novels are an
especially poisonous food offered to the unhealthy curiosity of
the people.'</p>

<p>'Doubtless,' replied the Minister of the Interior; 'but
there are other works quite as dangerous. I am speaking of
those cheap treatises which disseminate among the peasantry
and the working-classes a heap of false social and economic
science, the most evident effect of which is to seriously disturb
weak brains. A work of the kind to which I am alluding,
"Friend Jacques's Evening Chats," has just been submitted
to the committee for consideration. It is the story of a
sergeant who comes back to his native village and holds discussions
with the school-master every Sunday evening in the
presence of a score of labourers. Each discussion is upon a
different subject, such as new systems of cultivation, trades
unions, and the great part which the producer plays in society.
I have read this book, to which one of the clerks called my
attention, and it seems to me to be all the more dangerous
since it veils its baleful theories beneath a pretended admiration
for the imperial institutions. No one can be deceived by
it, however; it is clearly the production of a demagogue. And
so I was extremely surprised when I heard some members of
the committee speak of it in eulogistic terms. I have discussed
certain passages of it with them, but apparently without
convincing them. The author, they have assured me,
has even offered a copy of the book for your Majesty's acceptance.
On that account, sire, I thought it right, before taking
any active steps, to ask for your opinion and that of the
council.'</p>

<p>So saying Rougon fixed his glance on the Emperor, whose
shifty eyes at last settled on a paper-knife which was lying on
the table in front of him. His Majesty took up the knife and
began to turn and twist it while murmuring: 'Yes, yes,
"Friend Jacques's Evening Chats——"'</p>

<p>Then, without committing himself any further, he glanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
to the right and left of the table. 'You have perhaps seen
the book, gentlemen. I should be very glad to know——'</p>

<p>Then he stopped again. The ministers glanced furtively
at one another, each hoping that his neighbour would speak
and express an opinion. The silence, however, continued unbroken,
and the feeling of constraint increased. It seemed
clear that none of them had even known of the existence of
the book. At last the Minister for War took it upon himself
to express by a gesture the general ignorance which prevailed
of the publication in question.</p>

<p>The Emperor twisted his moustaches, showing no sign of
haste. 'Well, Monsieur Delestang, have you anything to
say?' he eventually inquired.</p>

<p>Delestang was restlessly moving on his chair, as though a
prey to some inward struggle. This direct question seemed
to decide him; however, before speaking, he glanced involuntarily
towards Rougon. 'I have had the book in my hands,
sire,' he said.</p>

<p>He checked himself, feeling that Rougon's big grey eyes
were fixed upon him; but then, observing the Emperor's
satisfaction, he began to speak again, though his lips could be
seen quivering slightly. 'I regret that I find myself in disagreement
with my friend and colleague the Minister of the
Interior. Certainly the publication in question might be less
sweeping in some parts and insist more than it does upon
that prudent deliberation with which all really useful progress
must be accomplished. Still, "Friend Jacques's Evening
Chats" seems to me to have been conceived with most excellent
intentions. The hopes which are expressed in it for the
future evince no hostility to imperial institutions. On the
contrary, indeed, they are what the legitimate expansion of
our institutions may lead us to expect.'</p>

<p>He paused again. Notwithstanding the care which he had
taken to turn towards the Emperor, he could not shake off
the consciousness that Rougon was sitting on the other side
of the table, leaning on his elbows and looking at him, pale
with surprise. Generally speaking, Delestang's views were
identical with those of the great man. And so the latter had a
momentary hope that a word from him might bring back his
erring disciple.</p>

<p>'Well, now,' he exclaimed with a frown, 'I'll just give you
an example. I'm sorry I haven't brought the book with me,
but I can give you the substance of a chapter which I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
very well. Jacques is speaking of two beggars who go through
the village soliciting alms from door to door, and, in reply to
a question from the school-master, he asserts that he will
show the peasants a way by which they will never have a
single poor person among them. Then follows a very elaborate
system for the extinction of pauperism. It contains the
whole communistic theory. Surely the Minister for Agriculture
and Commerce cannot approve of that chapter.'</p>

<p>Delestang summoned up all his courage and looked Rougon
boldly in the face. 'You are going too far in saying the
whole communistic theory,' he replied. 'It merely struck me
as being an ingenious exposition of the principles of combination.'
He had been searching in his portfolio as he spoke.
'I have got the book here,' he added.</p>

<p>Then he began to read the chapter under discussion. He
read it in a low monotonous voice, and his wise-looking face
assumed an expression of extraordinary gravity at certain
passages. The Emperor listened with an air of deep attention.
He seemed to particularly appreciate the more touching
portions, in which the author made his peasants speak in
a strain of childish stupidity. Meanwhile the ministers were
quite delighted. What an amusing affair! There now was
Rougon abandoned by Delestang, whom he had brought into
the ministry solely that he might have some one to rely upon
amidst the unexpressed hostility of his other colleagues. The
latter were often indignant with him for his constant arrogation
of power, that craving for authority which impelled him
to treat them as though they were mere clerks, while he himself
assumed the position of his Majesty's private adviser and
right-hand man. And now he was on the point of finding
himself completely isolated! This fellow, Delestang, thought
the others, was a man to be well received.</p>

<p>'There are perhaps one or two words——' muttered the
Emperor, when Delestang had finished his perusal; 'but,
really, taking it altogether, I don't see anything—eh, gentlemen?'</p>

<p>'It is quite innocent,' chorused the ministers.</p>

<p>Rougon made no reply to his Majesty, but seemed to bend
his shoulders. When he returned to the charge, he singled
out Delestang for his attack. For several minutes a contest
went on between them in short sentences. Handsome Delestang
grew warlike, and indulged in cutting remarks, while
Rougon's anger also gradually rose. He for the first time felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
his authority giving way beneath him. And springing all at
once to his feet, he addressed himself to the Emperor with
vehement gestures.</p>

<p>'Sire,' he said, 'it is a petty matter, and the book will be
authorised, since your Majesty in your wisdom declares there
is no danger in it. But I must warn you, sire, that it would
be perilous to confer on France one half of the liberties which
are claimed by this "Friend Jacques." You summoned me
to power under terrible circumstances. You told me that I
was not to attempt, by any untimely moderation, to reassure
those who were quaking with alarm. In accordance with your
commands, sire, I have made myself feared. I believe that I
have obeyed your slightest instructions and have rendered you
the services you expected of me. If any one should accuse
me of excessive severity or of abusing the power with which
your Majesty has entrusted me, such an accusation could only
come from an adversary of your Majesty's policy. Believe
me when I tell you that society is as deeply disturbed as ever
it was. In the few weeks that I have been in office, it has
unfortunately been impossible for me to heal the diseases
which are preying upon it. Anarchical passions are still
fermenting among the lower strata of the people.</p>

<p>'I do not wish to lay this festering wound bare to you, or
to exaggerate its horror, but it is my duty to remind you of its
existence, so that I may put your Majesty on your guard
against the generous impulses of your own heart. For a moment
it was possible to hope that the energy of the sovereign and
the solemnly expressed will of the nation had swept all
abominable periods of public baseness away without possibility
of revival. Events, however, have shown what a mournful
error this was. In the name of the country, sire, I beseech
you not to draw back your powerful hand. The danger does not
lie in the possession of excessive authority, but in the absence
of repressive laws. If you should draw back your hand, sire,
you would see the scum of the people bubbling up, you would
at once find yourself overwhelmed by revolutionary demands,
and your most energetic servants would soon be at a loss how
to defend you. I venture to press this upon you strongly, for
the dangers of the morrow would be terrible.</p>

<p>'Liberty without restraint is impossible in a country where
there exists a faction which is obstinately bent upon denying
the fundamental basis of the government. Many long years
must elapse before your Majesty's absolute power is accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
by all, before it effaces from men's memories the recollection
of old struggles, and passes so far beyond the pale of discussion
that it may be discussed without danger. And outside the
principle of despotic power, vigorously exercised, there is no
safety for France. On the day when your Majesty may consider
it your duty to restore to the nation the most harmless
of its liberties, on that day your Majesty will be committed to
everything. One liberty cannot be granted without a second;
and then comes a third one, and everything is swept away,
both institutions and dynasties! It is like an implacable,
devouring piece of machinery. First, the tip of the finger is
caught, then the hand is drawn in, then the arm, and finally
the whole body is ground to pieces.</p>

<p>'And, sire, since I have ventured to express myself so
freely on this matter, I will make this further remark. Parliamentary
rule once destroyed a French monarchy; do not let
us allow it to destroy an empire. The Corps Législatif ventures
to interfere too much as it is. Do not allow it any share
in directing the sovereign's policy. To do so would only give
rise to the most vehement and deplorable discussions. The
last general elections have once again testified to the country's
gratitude, but none the less, no fewer than five candidates
were elected whose disgraceful success ought to serve as a
warning. To-day the all-important question is to prevent the
formation of an opposition minority; and, what is still more
important, is to take care not to provide it—if by chance
it should come into existence—with weapons which might
enable it to contend against the constituted authority with
yet greater impudence than now. A parliament which holds
its tongue is a parliament which does some work.</p>

<p>'As for the press, sire, it is turning liberty into license.
Since I entered the ministry I have read the reports carefully,
and every morning I am filled with fresh disgust. The press
is the receptacle of nauseous leaven of every kind. It foments
revolutions, it is an ever-burning fire which serves to kindle
great conflagrations. It will only become useful when we
have brought it under our authority and can use its influence
as an instrument of government. At present I say nothing of
other forms of liberty, such as the liberty of combination, of
public meeting, or of doing anything a man likes. These,
however, are all respectfully asked for in "Friend Jacques's
Evening Chats." Later on they will be demanded. That is
what I am afraid of. I hope that your Majesty will fully understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
me. It is necessary that France should for a long time
yet feel the weight of a hand of iron.'</p>

<p>He went on in this strain for a long time, defending, with
increasing energy, the way in which he had used his authority,
sheltering himself beneath the principle of plenary power,
wrapping himself round with it, covering himself with it, as it
were, like a man who would avail himself of his armour to the
fullest extent possible. And in spite of his apparent excitement,
he retained sufficient coolness to keep a watch on his
colleagues and to note the effect of his words on their pale,
fixed faces. Then all at once he abruptly ceased speaking.</p>

<p>There was a rather long interval of silence. The Emperor
had again begun to play with his paper-knife.</p>

<p>'His Excellency the Minister of the Interior takes too
black a view of the situation,' at length said the Minister of
State. 'In my opinion nothing threatens our institutions.
Order is perfectly maintained. We can trust with confidence
to his Majesty's great wisdom. Indeed, it is a lack of such
confidence to show fear——'</p>

<p>'Certainly, certainly,' murmured several voices.</p>

<p>'I will add,' said the Minister for Foreign Affairs, 'that
France has never been more respected by Europe than she is
now. Everywhere abroad his Majesty's firm and dignified
policy is regarded with admiration. The opinion of the chancelleries
is that our country has entered for good upon an era
of peace and greatness.'</p>

<p>However, none of the ministers cared to attack the political
programme defended by Rougon. They all looked at
Delestang, who understood what was expected of him. He
began to speak, and compared the empire to an edifice.</p>

<p>'The principle of authority ought certainly not to be
shaken,' said he, 'but there is no necessity for systematically
shutting the door upon every public liberty. The empire is
like some great place of refuge, some vast and magnificent
edifice whose indestructible foundations have been laid by his
Majesty with his own hands. He is still engaged in raising
its walls; but the day will come when his task will be finished,
and he will have to think of how he can crown his edifice, and
it is then——'</p>

<p>'Never!' interrupted Rougon violently. 'The whole thing
will topple down!'</p>

<p>The Emperor stretched out his hand to stop the discussion.
He was smiling, and seemed to be awaking from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
reverie. 'Well, well,' he said; 'we are getting away from
current affairs. We will see about all this later on.' Then,
having risen from his seat, he added: 'It is late, gentlemen;
you must have <i>déjeuner</i> at the château.'</p>

<p>The council was now at an end. The ministers pushed
back their chairs and stood up and bowed to the Emperor,
who was slowly retiring. All at once, however, his Majesty
turned and muttered: 'A word with you, Monsieur Rougon,
I beg.'</p>

<p>Then as the Emperor took Rougon into the embrasure of
one of the windows, the other ministers thronged round
Delestang at the farther end of the room. They congratulated
him in subdued tones, with nods and becks and wreathed
smiles, quite a buzzing of murmured praise. The Minister
of State, a man of very shrewd mind and great experience,
was particularly flattering. He had an idea that it was lucky
to have a shallow-pated fellow for a friend. Meantime,
Delestang bowed with grave modesty to all the compliments
lavished upon him.</p>

<p>'After all,' said the Emperor to Rougon, 'I won't speak
to you here, come along with me,' and he thereupon took him
into his own study, a rather small room, where the furniture
was littered with books and newspapers. Then, having lighted
a cigarette, he showed Rougon a small model of a new cannon
lately invented by an officer. The little weapon looked like a
child's toy. His Majesty affected a very kindly tone, and tried
to convince the minister that he still possessed his favour.
Rougon, however, divined that an explanation of some sort
was coming, and he wanted to have the first word.</p>

<p>'Sire,' he began, 'I am well aware of the violence with
which I am attacked by those who surround your Majesty.'</p>

<p>The Emperor smiled without saying anything. It was
true, however, that the Court had again put itself in opposition
to Rougon. He was now accused of abusing his power, and
of compromising the empire by his harshness. The most
extraordinary tales were circulated about him, and the
corridors of the palace were full of complaints and stories,
which echoed every morning in the Emperor's study.</p>

<p>'Be seated, Monsieur Rougon, be seated,' his Majesty at
last said, in a good-natured way. And then, taking a seat
himself, he continued: 'People are always dinning things
into my ears. So it is, perhaps, best that I should quietly talk
them over with you. What is this affair of a notary at Niort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
who died after being arrested? A Monsieur Martineau, I
think?'</p>

<p>Rougon quietly entered into particulars. This Martineau,
he said, was a man who had very gravely compromised himself;
a Republican whose influence in the department might
have led to great danger. He had been arrested, and he had
since died.</p>

<p>'Yes, that's just it,' replied the Emperor; 'that's the
tiresome part of the matter. The opposition papers have got
hold of the story, and relate it in a very mysterious fashion,
and with a reticence which is calculated to have a most
deplorable effect. I am much distressed about it, Monsieur
Rougon.'</p>

<p>However, he said no more on that subject, but sat for a
few moments puffing at his cigarette.</p>

<p>'You have been down to Deux-Sèvres lately, and you were
present at some ceremony there, were you not?' he presently
continued. 'Are you quite sure of Monsieur Kahn's financial
stability?'</p>

<p>'Oh, quite so!' exclaimed Rougon. And he launched into
a series of explanatory details. M. Kahn, said he, was supported
by a very rich English company. The shares of the
railway from Niort to Angers were at a premium at the
Bourse. The undertaking had very fine prospects before it.</p>

<p>The Emperor, however, seemed incredulous. 'I have
heard a certain amount of fear expressed,' he said. 'You can
understand that it would be very unfortunate for your name to
be mixed up with a catastrophe. However, since you tell me
that there is no reason for fear——' Then he again broke off
and passed to a third subject. 'Now, about the prefect of
Deux-Sèvres. He is very unpopular, people tell me. He
appears to have thrown everything into confusion down there.
I hear, too, that he is the son of a retired process-server, whose
strange vagaries are the talk of the whole department. This
Monsieur du Poizat is a friend of yours, I believe?'</p>

<p>'One of my best friends, sire.'</p>

<p>As the Emperor now rose from his seat, Rougon also got
up. The former went to a window, and then came back
again, puffing out a little cloudlet of smoke.</p>

<p>'You have a good many friends, Monsieur Rougon,' he
said, with a meaning look.</p>

<p>'Yes, sire; a great many,' the minister frankly replied.</p>

<p>Evidently enough, the Emperor had hitherto merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
repeated the gossip of the château, the accusations made by
those who surrounded him. He was doubtless acquainted,
however, with other stories, matters which were unknown to
the Court, but of which he had learnt from his private agents,
and in which he took a yet livelier interest, for he revelled in
the spy system, in the secret manœuvring of the police. He
looked at Rougon for a moment, while a vague smile played
about his face. Then, in a confidential tone, and with a
somewhat playful air, he said: 'Oh, I know a good many
things; more, perhaps, than I care to know. Here is another
little matter, now; you have taken in your offices a young
man, a colonel's son, who has not obtained a bachelor's diploma.
It is not a matter of any importance, I am aware of
that; but if you only knew all the fuss that is made about
such things! Little things like these put everybody's back
up. It is really very bad policy on your part.'</p>

<p>Rougon made no reply. His Majesty had not finished.
He opened his lips as though he were going to say something,
but it was apparently something that he found rather difficult
to express, for he hesitated for a moment or two. At last he
stammered: 'I won't say anything to you about that usher,
one of your protégés named Merle, I think. But he gets
drunk and behaves insolently; and both the public and the
clerks complain of him. All this is very annoying, very
annoying indeed.' Then he raised his voice, and concluded
somewhat bluntly: 'You have too many friends, Monsieur
Rougon. All these people do you harm. It would be rendering
you a service to make you quarrel with them. Well, at
any rate let me have the resignation of Monsieur du Poizat,
and promise me that you will abandon all the others.'</p>

<p>Rougon had remained quite impassive. He now bowed,
and replied in a deep, meaning voice: 'On the contrary, sire,
I ask your Majesty for the ribbon of officer of the Legion of
Honour for the prefect of Deux-Sèvres. And I have several
other favours to solicit.' Then he took a memorandum-book
from his pocket, and continued: 'Monsieur Béjuin begs that
your Majesty will be graciously pleased to visit his cut-glass
works at Saint-Florent, when you go to Bourges. Colonel
Jobelin desires an appointment in the Imperial Palaces. The
usher Merle calls your Majesty's attention to the fact that he
has gained the military medal, and desires a tobacco-agency
for one of his sisters.'</p>

<p>'Is that all?' asked the Emperor, who had begun to smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
again. 'You are a magnificent patron. Your friends ought
to worship you.'</p>

<p>'No, they do not worship me, sire, they support me,' Rougon
replied with his blunt frankness.</p>

<p>This retort seemed to make a deep impression upon the
Emperor. Rougon had just revealed to him the whole secret
of his fidelity. On the day when he might allow his credit to
stagnate, on that day his credit would be killed; and in spite
of scandal, in spite of the discontent and treason of his hand,
it was his only possession and support, and he was obliged to
keep it sound and healthful, if he himself wished to remain
unshattered. The more he got for his friends—the greater and
the less deserved the favours that he lavished on them—the
stronger he became himself.</p>

<p>He added very respectfully, and in a very meaning tone:
'For the glory of your Majesty's reign, I hope from the bottom
of my heart that your Majesty may long preserve about
you the devoted servants who helped you to restore the
empire.'</p>

<p>The Emperor no longer smiled. He took a few steps
about the room, with downcast eyes and pensive air. He
seemed also to have turned pale and to be trembling slightly.
Presentiments occasionally affected his mystical nature with
great force. And to obviate the necessity of any immediate
determination, he decided to drop the subject. He again
assumed a kindly demeanour; and, referring to the discussion
which had taken place at the council, seemed even inclined to
think that Rougon was right, now that he could speak freely
without any danger of irrevocably committing himself. The
country, said he, was certainly not yet ripe for liberty. For a
long time to come an energetic hand would be necessary to
guide matters with resolution and firmness. Then he
concluded by once more assuring the minister of his entire
confidence. He gave him full liberty of action, and confirmed
all his previous instructions. Rougon, however, thought it
necessary to add another word on the subject.</p>

<p>'Sire,' he said, 'I could never allow myself to be at the
mercy of malevolent gossip. I stand in need of stability
if I am to accomplish the great task for which I am now
responsible.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur Rougon,' replied the Emperor, 'go on fearlessly;
I am with you.'</p>

<p>Then, bringing the conversation to a close, he stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
towards the door, followed by the minister. They both went
out and crossed several apartments on their way to the dining-room.
Just as they were reaching it, the Emperor turned
round and again took Rougon aside. 'You don't approve,
then,' he asked, in an undertone, 'of that scheme for a new
nobility? I should have been very glad to see you support it.
Study the matter.' Then, without waiting for a reply, he
added with that quiet stubbornness which formed part of his
character:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56654/56654-h/56654-h.htm#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> 'There's no hurry, however. I will wait; for ten
years, if it be necessary.'</p>

<p>After <i>déjeuner</i>, which lasted scarcely half an hour, the
ministers went into a small adjoining drawing-room where
coffee was served. They remained there chatting for a little
time, standing round the Emperor. However, Clorinde,
whom the Empress had kept with her all this time, came
to look for her husband, with the easy manner of a woman
who mixed freely with politicians. She shook hands with
several of the ministers. They all clustered round her, and
the subject of conversation was changed. However, his
Majesty began to pay the young woman such marked
attention, and kept so close to her, that their excellencies
thought it discreet to take themselves off by degrees. Opening
one of the glass doors which led on to the terrace of the
château, four of them went outside, and these were speedily
followed by three others. Only two remained in the room to
keep up an appearance of propriety. The Minister of State,
with a pleasant, cheery expression upon his aristocratic face,
had taken Delestang in tow, and was pointing out Paris from
the terrace. Rougon, likewise standing in the sunshine, also
became absorbed in the spectacle of the great city looming
like a mass of bluish cloud on the horizon beyond the great
green carpet of the Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p>That morning, Clorinde was looking very beautiful.
Clumsily dressed, as usual, with her gown of pale cherry-coloured
silk dragging over the floor, she appeared to have
slipped into her things in all haste, as if goaded on by some
strong desire. She laughed with the Emperor, and her
whole demeanour was very free and unreserved. She had
made a conquest of his Majesty at a ball given by the Naval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
Minister which she had attended in the character of the
Queen of Hearts, wearing diamond hearts about her neck and
her wrists and her knees; and ever since that evening she
had remained on very friendly terms with Napoleon, jesting
playfully whenever he condescended to compliment her upon
her beauty.</p>

<p>'Look, Monsieur Delestang,' the Minister of State was
saying to his colleague on the terrace, 'see yonder on the left,
what a wonderfully soft blue hue there is about the dome of
the Panthéon.'</p>

<p>Then, while Delestang gazed admiringly at the prospect,
the Minister of State cast furtive glances into the little
drawing-room through the open window. The Emperor was
bending forward, and was speaking with his lips close to the
young woman's face, while she threw herself back with tightly
strained breast as though to escape him. Nothing could be
seen of his Majesty from outside save an indistinct profile, the
tip of an ear, a long red nose, and a heavy mouth half-buried
beneath a quivering moustache. His cheek and eyes were
glowing, whilst Clorinde, who looked irritatingly fascinating,
gently swayed her head like a coy young shepherdess.</p>

<p>In spite of all the unpleasantness at the council, Rougon
returned to Paris with Delestang and Clorinde. On the
journey home the young woman appeared anxious to make
her peace with him. She no longer manifested that nervous
restlessness which in the morning had impelled her to choose
disagreeable subjects of conversation, but even occasionally
looked at Rougon with an air of smiling compassion. When
the landau, passing through the Bois de Boulogne, now steeped
in sunshine, rolled gently alongside the lakes, she murmured
with a sigh of enjoyment: 'What a lovely day it is!' Then,
after a moment's reverie, she said to her husband: 'Tell me,
is your sister, Madame de Combelot, still in love with the
Emperor?'</p>

<p>'Henriette is mad!' replied Delestang, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>

<p>But Rougon intervened: 'Yes, indeed, she's still in love,'
said he: 'people assert that she actually threw herself at his
Majesty's feet one day. He raised her and advised her to be
patient.'</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, indeed,' cried Clorinde gaily, '<i>She'll</i> have a
long time to wait!'</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="XII" id="XII">XII</a></h3>

<h3>DEFECTION</h3>


<p>Clorinde was now revelling in a florescence of fantasy and
power. In character she was still the big eccentric girl who
had scoured Paris on a livery-stable hack in search of a
husband; but the big girl had developed into a woman, who
calmly performed the most extraordinary actions, having at
length realised her long-cherished dream of becoming a
power. Her everlasting prowlings in out-of-the-way neighbourhoods,
her correspondence which inundated the four
corners of France and Italy with letters, her continued contact
with politicians, into whose intimacy she managed to insinuate
herself, and all her erratic schemings, full of gaps
and illogical as they were, had ended in the acquirement of
real and indisputable influence. She still indulged in strange
eccentricities, and propounded wild schemes and extravagant
hopes, even when she was talking seriously. And when she
went out, she still took her tattered portfolio with her, carrying
it in her arms like a baby, and with such an air of earnestness
that people in the streets smiled as she passed them in
her dirty, draggling skirts. However, she was consulted now,
and even feared. No one could have exactly told the origin
of her power, which seemed to come from numerous distant
and invisible sources, now difficult to trace. Folks knew
nothing but a few scraps of gossip, anecdotes that were
whispered from ear to ear. There was something to mystify
one in the young woman's strangely compound character, in
which wild imagination was linked to common sense which
commanded attention and obedience, while apart from all
mental attributes there was her magnificent person, in which,
perhaps, lay the true secret of her power. It mattered little,
however, upon what foundations Clorinde's throne was
reared. It was sufficient that she did reign, though it were
in a whimsical, erratic fashion, and that people bowed down
before her.</p>

<p>This was a real period of power for the young woman. In
her dressing-room, amidst a litter of dirty basins, she contrived
to centralise the policy of all the courts of Europe.
She received information, even detailed reports, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
slightest pulsations of governmental life were carefully noted,
before the embassies did, and without anyone knowing whence
her news was derived. As a natural consequence she was
surrounded by a court of bankers, and diplomatists, and
friends, who came to her in the hope of obtaining information.
The bankers showed her particular attention. She had
enabled one of them to gain a hundred million francs in a
single haul by merely telling him of an approaching change
of ministry in a neighbouring state. Truth to tell, however,
she disdained to employ her knowledge for purposes of gain,
and she readily told all that she knew—the gossip of diplomatists,
and the talk of the different capitals—for the mere
pleasure of hearing herself speak, and of showing that she
had her eyes upon Turin, Vienna, Madrid, and London, as
well as on Berlin and St. Petersburg. She could supply
endless information concerning the health of the different
sovereigns, their amours and habits, the politicians of the
various states, and all the scandals of even the smallest German
duchies. She judged statesmen in a single phrase;
jumped from north to south without the slightest transition;
spoke as carelessly of the different countries of Europe as if
they had been her own, as if, indeed, the whole wide world,
with its cities and nations, had formed part of a box of playthings,
whose little cardboard houses and wooden men she
could set up, and move about as she pleased. And, when at
last her tongue ceased wagging, and she was tired of chattering,
she would snap her fingers, as though to say that this
was quite as much as all these things were worth.</p>

<p>For the time being, amidst her many tangled schemes,
there was one very serious matter which excited her warmest
enthusiasm, and on which she tried her best to keep silent,
though, occasionally, she could not deny herself the pleasure
of alluding to it. She wanted Venice. Whenever she spoke
of the great Italian minister, she referred to him familiarly as
'Cavour.' 'Cavour,' said she, 'did not want it, but I want
it, and he has understood.' Morning and night she shut herself
up at the embassy with Chevalier Rusconi. And tranquilly
lounging, throwing back her narrow, but goddess-like
brow, as if in a sort of somnambulism, she would utter scraps
of disconnected sentences, shreds of revelations; a hint of
a secret interview between the Emperor and some foreign
statesman; a projected treaty of alliance, some clauses of
which were still under discussion; a war which would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
place in the coming spring. On other days she became
excited and angry, kicked the chairs about her room and
knocked the basins over at the risk of breaking them. On
these occasions she looked like some angry queen who has
been betrayed by imbecile ministers, and sees her kingdom
going from bad to worse; and, with a tragic air, she would
stretch her bare majestic arm in the direction of Italy and
clench her fist, exclaiming: 'Ah! if I were over yonder there
would be none of this folly!'</p>

<p>However, the worries of high politics did not prevent
Clorinde from engaging in all sorts of other businesses, in
which she seemed to get quite lost. She was often to be
found sitting on her bed with the contents of her large portfolio
spread over the counterpane, while she plunged her arms
into the papers, distracted and crying with irritation. She
would be unable to find anything amidst such a chaos of
documents; or else, after long hunting for some lost batch of
papers, she would at length discover it behind some piece of
furniture or amongst her old boots or dirty linen. When she
went out to conclude any particular piece of business, she
generally contrived to involve herself in two or three fresh
affairs on her way. She was for ever rushing about to all
sorts of places, lived in a perfect whirl of ideas, a state of perpetual
excitement; while beneath her lay the mazy depths of
mysterious, unfathomable intrigues. When she came home
again in the evening, after a day's scouring of Paris, tired out
by climbing so many flights of stairs, and carrying in the folds
of her skirts an odour of all the strange haunts which she had
visited, no one would have guessed one half of the errands
that she had been engaged upon. And if anyone happened to
question her, she only laughed; she herself did not always
remember what she had been doing.</p>

<p>It was about this time that she had the extraordinary
whim of engaging a private room at one of the great restaurants
on the boulevard. The house in the Rue du Colisée
was so far away from everything, she said; she wanted a
place in some central position; so she turned the private
room at the restaurant into an office. For two months she
received there all who wanted to see her, simply attended by
the waiters, who had to usher in persons of the highest
position. Great functionaries, ambassadors, and ministers
presented themselves at the restaurant. Clorinde, entirely at
her ease there, made them sit down on the couch, damaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
by the supper parties of the Carnival, while she herself remained
in front of the table, the cloth of which was always laid, strewn
with bread-crumbs and littered with papers. She camped
there like a general officer. One day, however, when she did
not feel very well, she calmly went upstairs to the top of the
house and lay down on the bed of the <i>maître d'hôtel</i> who
usually waited upon her, and she could not be induced to go
home till it was nearly midnight.</p>

<p>Delestang, in spite of everything, was a happy man. He
appeared to be quite ignorant of his wife's eccentricities. She
was now completely master of him, and treated him as she
liked, while he never made the least complaint. His natural
temperament predisposed him to this kind of servitude. He
found far too much happiness in the secret surrender of
his authority to attempt any revolt. In the privacy of
their domestic life, it was he who rendered Clorinde all kinds
of little services. He hunted about for her lost boots, or
went through all the linen in the wardrobe to find a chemise
that was not in holes. He was quite satisfied with preserving
a serene appearance of superiority when he was at other
people's houses. The unruffled air of loving protection with
which he then spoke of his wife almost won him public
respect.</p>

<p>Clorinde, having now become all-powerful at home, had
decided to bring her mother back from Turin. She intended,
she said, that Countess Balbi should henceforth spend six
months of each year with her. She seemed to be suddenly
overwhelmed by an outburst of filial affection. She threw a
whole floor of the house into confusion so as so instal the old
lady as near as possible to her own apartments. She even
provided a door of communication between her dressing-room
and her mother's bedchamber. In Rougon's presence
especially she made an excessive parade of her affection,
indulging in the most exaggerated Italian expressions of endearment.
How had she ever been able, she wondered, to
resign herself to such a long separation from her mother, she
who, before her marriage, had never left her for an hour?
She accused herself of want of heart. But it was not her
fault, she protested; she had been forced to yield to other
people's advice, to give way before pretended necessities, in
which even now she could see no force. Rougon remained
quite unmoved by this rebellion. He had altogether ceased
to lecture her, and no longer attempted to make her one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the most distinguished women in Paris. In former times she
had filled up a gap in his life, but now that he was in the forefront
of the battle with fourteen hours' work to get through
every day, he gave little thought to love and passion. Nevertheless,
he continued to treat her with an air of affection,
mingled with that kind of contempt which he usually manifested
for women. He came to see her from time to time, and
then his eyes would occasionally gleam as in the days of old.
She was still his one weakness; the one woman who perturbed
him.</p>

<p>Since Rougon had gone to live at the official residence of
the Minister of the Interior where his friends complained that
they could no longer see him in intimate fashion, Clorinde
had thought of receiving the band at her own house, and it
had gradually become a custom for the others to go there.
To mark more plainly the fact that these receptions took the
place of those in the Rue Marbeuf, she fixed the same evenings
as Rougon had chosen, namely Sundays and Thursdays.
There was this difference, however, that in the Rue du Colisée
the guests remained till one o'clock in the morning. Clorinde
received them in her boudoir, as Delestang still kept the keys
of the big drawing-room for fear of it being damaged by
grease-spots. And as the boudoir was a very small apartment,
Clorinde left the doors of her dressing-room and bedroom
open; so that, very frequently, the friends were to be found
crowding together in the sleeping-chamber amid a litter of
feminine finery.</p>

<p>On Thursdays and Sundays, Clorinde usually made a point
of hastening home early so as to get through her dinner in
time to receive her guests. But, in spite of all her efforts to
remember these evening receptions, she twice forgot all about
them, and was taken quite aback on finding a crowd of people
in her bedroom when she returned home after midnight.
One Thursday, towards the end of May, she got home at the
unusually early hour of five. She had been out on foot and
had preferred to walk all the way from the Place de la Concorde
in a heavy fall of rain rather than pay thirty sous for a
cab. She was quite soaked when she reached the house, and
she went straight to her dressing-room where her maid, Antonia,
whose mouth was smeared with jam, undressed her, laughing
merrily the while at the stream of water which poured from
her mistress's clothes on to the floor.</p>

<p>'There is a gentleman come to see you,' said the servant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
presently, as she sat down on the floor to take off Clorinde's
boots. 'He has been waiting for an hour.'</p>

<p>Clorinde asked her what he was like. The maid, with her
greasy dress and unkempt hair, and her white teeth gleaming
in her dusky face, remained sitting on the floor. The gentleman,
she said, was fat and pale, and stern-looking.</p>

<p>'Oh, it must be Monsieur de Reuthlinguer the banker,'
cried Clorinde. 'I remember now, he was to come at four
o'clock. Well, let him wait. You have the bath ready for me,
haven't you?'</p>

<p>Then she quietly got into the bath which was concealed
behind a curtain in a corner of the room, and while in it, she
read the letters which had arrived during her absence. Half
an hour went by when Antonia, after leaving the room for a
few minutes, came back again and said to her mistress: 'The
gentleman saw you come in and would very much like to
speak to you, madame.'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear, I'd forgotten all about him!' cried Clorinde.
'Come and dress me, quickly.'</p>

<p>However, the young woman showed much capriciousness
over her toilette that evening. In spite of the neglect with
which she usually treated her person, she was occasionally
seized with a sudden idolatry for it. At these times she
would indulge in the most elaborate toilette; even having her
limbs rubbed with ointments and balms and aromatic oils, of
a nature known only to herself, which had been bought at
Constantinople, so she said, from the perfumer to the Seraglio,
by an Italian diplomatist, a friend of hers. While Antonia
was rubbing her, she threw herself into statuesque attitudes.
This anointing made her skin white and soft, and beautiful as
marble. One of the oils, of which she herself carefully
counted the drops as she let them fall on to a small piece of
flannel, had the miraculous quality of at once effacing every
wrinkle. And when this business was over, she would commence
a minute examination of her hands and feet. She
could have spent a whole day in adoring herself.</p>

<p>At the end of three quarters of an hour, however, when
Antonia had slipped some wraps over her, she suddenly
seemed to recollect her visitor. 'Oh, dear, the Baron!' she
cried. 'Well, never mind, show him in here!'</p>

<p>M. de Reuthlinguer had been patiently sitting in Clorinde's
boudoir, with his hands clasped over his knees for more than
two hours. He was a pale frigid man of austere morals, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
possessor of one of the largest fortunes in Europe, and for
some time past he had been in the habit of thus dancing
attendance upon Clorinde twice or thrice a week. He even
invited her to his own house, that abode of rigid decorum and
glacial strictness, where the young woman's startling eccentricities
quite shocked the footmen.</p>

<p>'Good day, baron!' Clorinde exclaimed as he came in.
'I'm having my hair dressed, so don't look.'</p>

<p>An indulgent smile played round the baron's pale lips.
After bowing with the most respectful courtesy, he remained
standing quite close to her, without a quiver of his eyelids.</p>

<p>'You've come for news, haven't you?' she asked. 'Well,
I've just heard something.'</p>

<p>Then she got up and dismissed Antonia, who went away
leaving the comb stuck in her mistress's hair. Clorinde was
doubtless afraid of being overheard, for laying her hand on
the banker's shoulder and, standing on tip-toe, she whispered
something in his ear. As he listened to her, he nodded his
head briskly.</p>

<p>'There!' concluded the young woman, raising her voice.
'You can go now.'</p>

<p>But the banker took hold of her bare arm and brought her
back towards him to ask for certain explanations. He could
not have been more at his ease if he had been talking to one
of his clerks, instead of to this beautiful woman in deshabille.
When he left her, he invited her to dine at his house on the
following day. His wife was very anxious to see her again,
he said. She accompanied him to the door, but all at once
crossed her arms over her bosom and turned very red as she
exclaimed: 'Good gracious! I was actually about to go out
with you like this!'</p>

<p>She now began to scold Antonia for being so slow. She
would never get finished! she cried; and then she scarcely
gave the girl time to dress her hair, saying that she hated
being so long over her toilette. In spite of the time of the
year, she insisted upon wearing a long robe of black velvet, a
sort of loose blouse, drawn in at the waist with a red silk
girdle. Twice already, a servant had come to tell her that
dinner was served. However, as she passed through her bedroom,
she found three gentlemen there, of whose presence no
one had had the slightest idea. They were the three political
refugees, Signori Brambilla, Staderino, and Viscardi. Clorinde,
however, showed no surprise at meeting them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>'Have you been waiting for me long?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' they replied, gently nodding their heads.</p>

<p>They had arrived before the banker, but had remained extremely
quiet, for political misfortunes had made them taciturn
and reflective. They were seated side by side on the same
couch, all three lolling in much the same position, with big
extinguished cigars between their lips. But they now rose
and clustered round Clorinde, and a rapid muttering in Italian
ensued. The young woman seemed to be giving them instructions.
One of the refugees took notes in cipher in a
pocket-book, while the others, appearing much excited by
what they heard, stifled slight cries with their gloved hands.
Then they all three went off in single file, with quite impenetrable
faces.</p>

<p>That Thursday evening it had been arranged that several
of the ministers should confer together on a very important
financial matter. When Delestang went off after dinner, he
told Clorinde that he would bring Rougon back with him, at
which his wife made a little grimace which seemed to imply
that she was not very anxious to see her whilom master.
There was as yet no positive break in their friendship, but the
young woman showed an increasing coldness towards Rougon.</p>

<p>Towards nine o'clock, M. Kahn and M. Béjuin arrived
together. They were the first of the band to put in an
appearance, but were soon followed by Madame Correur.
Clorinde was found in her bedroom, stretched upon a couch
there. She complained of one of those extraordinary and unheard-of
troubles which suddenly came upon her every now
and then. She must have swallowed a fly, she said, while
drinking, for she could feel it flying about inside her stomach.
Draped in her long black velvet robe, her shoulders supported
by three pillows, she none the less looked superbly beautiful
with her pale face and bare arms, recalling indeed one of those
reclining, dreaming figures, which sculptors portray on monuments.
At her feet was Luigi Pozzo, gently twanging the
strings of a guitar. He had deserted painting for music.</p>

<p>'Sit down, won't you?' she said to the others. 'Please
excuse me. A wretched little insect has got inside me
somehow.'</p>

<p>Pozzo went on twanging his guitar, and singing in a low
voice, with an ecstatic expression on his face, as if lost in a
reverie. Madame Correur wheeled a chair up to Clorinde's
side, and M. Kahn and M. Béjuin, after a little searching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
also succeeded in finding seats. It was not an easy matter to
do so, for the five or six chairs were hidden beneath a litter
of dresses and petticoats, so that when Colonel Jobelin and
his son Auguste arrived five minutes later, they had to remain
standing.</p>

<p>'Little one,' said Clorinde to Auguste, whom she still
treated quite familiarly in spite of his seventeen years, 'go
and bring two chairs out of my dressing-room.'</p>

<p>These were cane-seated chairs, with all the varnish worn
away by the damp linen which was constantly hung over their
backs. The bedroom was lighted by a single lamp with a
shade of pink paper. There was another in the dressing-room
and a third in the boudoir, which, seen through the doorways,
seemed to be full of dusky shadow, as though merely illuminated
by a night-light. The bedroom itself, with hangings
of a tender mauve that had now turned to a pale grey, was
full of a floating haze, in which one could scarcely distinguish
the rents in the coverings of the easy-chairs, the dust-marks
on the furniture and the big ink-stain in the middle of the
carpet where some inkstand had fallen with such force that
even the wainscotting was splashed. The bed-curtains had
been drawn, probably in order to conceal the untidiness of
the bed. And amidst this hazy gloom, there rose a powerful
scent as though all the bottles and flasks in the dressing-room
had remained uncorked. Clorinde obstinately refused to have
any of the windows open, even in warm weather.</p>

<p>'What a nice scent you've got here,' said Madame
Correur, complimentarily.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's I who smell so nice,' the young woman naïvely
replied.</p>

<p>Then she began to talk of the essences which she obtained
direct from the perfumer to the Sultanas, and even
held her arm under Madame Correur's nose. Her black
velvet blouse had got a little disarranged, and her feet, in
their little red slippers, showed below it. Pozzo, languid and
intoxicated by the strong perfumes which she exhaled, was
tapping his instrument gently with his thumb.</p>

<p>However, after a few minutes, the conversation turned of
necessity on Rougon, as was invariably the case every Thursday
and Sunday. The band seemed to come together for the
sole purpose of discussing this one everlasting subject. Its
members felt an ever-growing rancour against the great man,
a craving to relieve themselves by ceaseless recrimination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Clorinde no longer had any trouble to set them going. They
always arrived with a fresh burden of grievances, ever discontented
and jealous, actually embittered by what Rougon
had done for them, and burning with a violent fever of ingratitude.</p>

<p>'Have you seen the fat man to-day?' the colonel asked.</p>

<p>Rougon was no longer 'the great man.'</p>

<p>'No,' said Clorinde; 'but we may see him here this evening.
My husband persists in bringing him to see me.'</p>

<p>'I was in a café this afternoon, where they were criticising
him very severely,' the colonel continued, after a pause.
'They say that his position is very shaky, and that he won't
last another two months.'</p>

<p>M. Kahn made a gesture of contempt. 'Well, for my
part,' he said, 'I don't give him three weeks. Rougon, you
see, is not cut out for governing He is too fond of power,
and gets intoxicated with it; and then he strikes out right
and left and treats people with revolting harshness. During
these last five months he has been guilty of some most monstrous
acts.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, indeed,' the colonel interrupted; 'all kinds of
injustices and unfairnesses and absurdities. He abuses his
power, most certainly he does.'</p>

<p>Madame Correur said nothing, but expressed, by a gesture,
her opinion that Rougon's head was not particularly well
balanced.</p>

<p>'Ah, yes, indeed,' said M. Kahn, noticing the gesture.
'He hasn't got a well-fixed head, has he?'</p>

<p>Then M. Béjuin observed that the others were looking at
him, and felt called upon to say something. 'No! Rougon's
not at all an able man,' he remarked; 'not at all.'</p>

<p>Clorinde lay back on her pillows, gazing at the luminous
circle which the lamp cast on the ceiling, and letting the
others talk on. When they paused, she said, with the intention
of starting them again: 'There is no doubt that he
has abused his power, but he asserts that the things with
which people reproach him were done for the sole purpose of
obliging his friends. I was talking to him on the subject the
other day. The services which he has rendered you——'</p>

<p>'Rendered us! rendered us!' they all cried furiously.
And they went on talking all together, eager to protest
against any such insinuation. However, M. Kahn shouted
the others down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>'The services which he has rendered me! That's a fine
joke! I had to wait two years for my railway grant, with
the result that the prospects of the scheme, once very brilliant,
have suffered considerably. If he is such a friend of
mine, why doesn't he come to my assistance now? I asked
him to obtain the Emperor's sanction to a bill authorising
the amalgamation of my company with the Western Company,
and he told me that I must wait. Rougon's services to me,
indeed! Well, I should like to know what they are! He
has never done anything for me, and he <i>can't</i> do anything
now!'</p>

<p>'And I, and I, do you imagine that I am indebted to him
for anything?' cried the colonel, breaking in before Madame
Correur could speak. 'He surely doesn't take any credit to
himself for that commander's cross, which had been promised
to me for five years and more? He has taken Auguste into
his office, it is true; but I bitterly regret now that I ever let
the boy go there. If I had put him into business he would
have been earning twice as much. That wretched Rougon
told me only yesterday that he would not be able to increase
Auguste's pay for another eighteen months. That is the way
he ruins his credit for the sake of his friends!'</p>

<p>At last Madame Correur also was able to relieve her
feelings. 'Did he mention my name?' she said, bending
towards Clorinde. 'I never asked that much from him; and
have yet to learn the nature of his services to me. He can't
say as much with regard to my services to him; and if I
liked to talk——But no matter. I certainly asked him
for a few favours on behalf of my friends. I don't deny that.
I delight in being of use to anyone. But I must say that
everything he has a hand in turns out badly, and that his
favours seem to bring ill-luck. There's that poor Herminie
Billecoq, an old pupil of Saint Denis, who was wronged by an
officer, and for whom Rougon procured a dowry. Well, the
poor girl came to me with a dreadful story this morning.
There's no chance of her getting married after all, for the
officer has absconded, taking the dowry with him. And you
understand me. Anything that Rougon has done at my
request has been done for others, and not for myself. When
I came back from Coulonges, after the settlement of my
brother's affairs, I went to tell him of the tricks that Madame
Martineau had been playing with respect to the division of the
property. I wanted the house in which I was born as part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
my share, but the wretched woman contrived to keep it herself.
Well, do you know what was the only answer I could
get from Rougon? He told me three times over that he
couldn't trouble himself any further about the miserable
business!'</p>

<p>While Madame Correur was speaking, M. Béjuin, in his
turn, had begun to show signs of excitement, and he now
stammered: 'I am exactly in the same position as Madame.
I have never asked Rougon for anything—never, never! Anything
that he may have done has been done in spite of me,
and without my knowing anything about it. He avails himself
of one's silence to take every advantage of one, yes,
every advantage.'</p>

<p>His words died away in a mutter; and then all four remained
for a moment silently wagging their heads.</p>

<p>Presently M. Kahn resumed, in a solemn voice: 'The
truth of the matter is this. Rougon is an ungrateful fellow.
You all remember how we used to scour Paris, working to get
him back into office. We devoted ourselves to his cause to
such a point as to take our meals anywhere and anyhow.
And he then contracted a debt towards us which in his whole
lifetime he could not fairly discharge. Now, however, he
finds gratitude too heavy a burden for him, and so he casts
us adrift. Well, we might have expected as much!'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes, indeed,' cried the others. 'He owes everything
to us, and he's repaying us in a pretty fashion.'</p>

<p>Then for a while they completely overwhelmed Rougon
with an enumeration of all the things they had done for him;
whenever one of them became silent another brought forward
some still more crushing detail. The colonel, however, suddenly
felt uneasy about Auguste, who had disappeared from
the bedchamber. Just then a peculiar noise was heard in
the dressing-room—a sort of gentle, continuous dabbling
sound—and the colonel hurried off to see what it could be.
He then found Auguste apparently much interested in the
bath, which Antonia had forgotten to empty. Some slices of
lemon, which Clorinde had used for her nails, were floating
on the water, and these Auguste was inquisitively examining.</p>

<p>'The boy is quite a nuisance,' murmured Clorinde. 'He
goes poking about everywhere.'</p>

<p>'Really, now,' said Madame Correur, who seemed to have
been waiting for the colonel's absence, 'the thing in which
Rougon is most deficient is tact. Between ourselves, I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
say, now that the gallant colonel can't hear us, that it was a
great mistake on Rougon's part to take that young man into
his office in defiance of the regulations. That is not the kind
of service a man ought to render to his friends. It only
brings him into discredit.'</p>

<p>However, Clorinde interrupted her. 'Do go, my dear
madam,' said she, 'and see what they're doing in the bathroom.'</p>

<p>M. Kahn had begun to smile, and, when Madame Correur
left the room, he also lowered his voice and put in a word.
'How fine it is to hear her talk,' he said. 'The colonel has,
no doubt, been well looked after by Rougon, but she herself
has no reason to complain. Rougon absolutely compromised
himself on her account in that troublesome Martineau business.
He showed himself very deficient in morality in that
matter. Nobody ought to kill a man for the mere sake of
pleasing an old friend, ought he?'</p>

<p>Then M. Kahn got up and began to stroll about the room,
and ultimately he went b</p></body></html>
