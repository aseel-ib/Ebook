<h3>I
<br>HOW IT BEGAN</h3>
<p>It all began the morning after a Zepp raid.
The village of Dutton had had a very narrow
escape. Six bombs had been dropped in the
night, but not a single person had been hurt.
One sad thing had happened, however, and
Danny Moor was the first one to make it
known in the village, and the first one to decide
how the damage should be put right. The
Huns had dropped a bomb thirty yards from
the little grey church, and a great piece of metal
had smashed to fragments a beautiful stained-glass
window. Danny was sad, for the Cubs
loved that window very much. It represented
the shepherds at Bethlehem on the first Christmas
morning, and the Cubs had discovered to
their delight that the Child Christ in His
Mother’s arms had His two fingers raised, as
if in the Cub salute! So they looked upon the
little chapel where the window was as their
special corner of the church, and it was there
that the monthly church parade took place.
Now, the window lay in splinters of shimmering
glass upon the floor, and the morning sun
streamed through a jagged hole where before
used to be the little figure of the Holy Child,
smiling down upon the Cubs. But as Danny
stood looking sadly at the blue sky through
the hole, a bright idea came to him, and he
made a vow that before long a new window
should be put up in the place of the broken
one, and that he and the Cubs would pay
for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>After school that morning he got the other
Sixers and Seconds to come and hold a special
council in the corner of his garden, and then
he told them the sad news. “But I’ve vowed
we’ll put up a new window,” he said; “will
you help?” They all agreed at once, and
Fred Codding, practical as usual, began to
count the cost. “It’ll cost an awful lot,” he
said, “I should think nearly a pound.” “Oh!”
said the others. “Well,” continued Fred,
“there’s eighteen of us; say we each gave
sixpence, that would be 9s. Then my six has
got 2s. we saved up for buying a bat—we’ll
give that.” “Eleven bob,” said Danny,
“good.” “I say,” said Freckles, “what about
asking Mr. Fox to give that 5s. the squire
gave him for our picnic next Saturday?”
“Good idea,” said one of the others, “that’s
sixteen bob. I bet we can raise four more
somehow.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>So directly school was over that afternoon
they dashed down to their chaplain to tell
him the splendid good turn they were going
to do. He was very pleased. But he said
he thought £1 would not do it. He looked
up the cost of stained-glass windows in a big
book. “I’m afraid it will be £20,” he said.
The Cubs did not gasp nor show what they
felt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>“All right, sir,” said Danny. “We’ll get
£20, somehow—won’t we, boys?—’cos we’ve
promised to.”</p>
<p>They were rather silent as they walked home.
And yet they felt sure something would turn
up to enable them to keep their promise.
As they parted they promised each other to
think out a good idea, and never to give up
till they had earned enough money for the
window.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>The next day Danny had a bright idea. It
was this: that the Pack should start wastepaper
collecting. “I’ve been doing sums all
the morning,” said Danny, “and I’ve found
out that we could get £20 in seven months
if we worked hard. Of course it would take
all our Saturdays.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>“I suppose you are going round with your
baby’s pram,” said Freckles. Danny punched
his head for him, and then explained proudly
that the Scoutmaster had promised the use
of the trek cart. At that the Pack gave a
howl of delight, and the waste-paper scheme
was passed unanimously by the council. The
£20 began to seem more possible now; and
the Pack meant to do its best.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>It was a month later that something happened
which set Danny’s detective’s heart
beating fast with hope and excitement. The
Pack had been slaving hard at waste paper,
and had already collected and sold £3 worth.
Danny, tired with the day’s work, was leaning
against his garden gate in the cool of the
evening when his old friend, the village policeman,
sauntered up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>“Hello, Danny the Detective,” he said,
“come and have a look at my old sow—she’s
got a litter of ten little ’uns, born this morning.”
Danny loved baby pigs, and so he went with
Mr. Bates at once. But as soon as Mr. Bates
had him in his own yard, and out of earshot
of other people, he forgot about the pigs, and
turned to Danny with a solemn look on his
face. “I want a conversation with you,
private-like,” he said. “I’m going to tell
you something, if you’ll promise never to
speak a word to any other folks about it.”
“I promise on my honour as a Wolf Cub,”
said Danny. “Go ahead, guv’nor.” “Well,”
said Mr. Bates, “you done good work with
them German spies last autumn. You’ve got
a proper detective’s brain, you have. I want
you just to keep your eyes on Mr. Bulky, him
what goes round tuning up the rich folks’
pianers. I don’t say as how I have anything
at all against him at present, but I don’t like
the looks of him. Don’t you say a word, but
just you keep your eyes open, and poke about,
careful-like, round his place, and let me know
if you find out something. I’m afraid to say
anything at the police station, for fear he finds
out he’s being watched. So I says to myself,
‘I’ll put Danny the Detective on his tracks.’”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3>II
<br>THE SUSPECTED PERSON</h3>
<p>Mr. Bulky was a man with a fat, pale face
and shifty little eyes. He bicycled about all
over the neighbourhood with a small black bag,
and tuned the pianos in the big houses. When
he was not out tuning pianos he would always be
found either playing pieces by Mendelssohn
in his front parlour, or attending to his famous
prize fowls. These he was very proud of,
and would often travel to distant parts of the
country with a hen in a basket to exhibit her
at some poultry show. He even went to the
Continent, sometimes, to buy poultry and
pigeons. No one in Dutton liked him. He
had lived there only about five years. His
sister, a very stout person, called Miss Bulky,
kept house for him. He had a large cottage
on the outskirts of Dutton. And now Mr.
Bates, the policeman, suspected him, and had
put Danny on his track! Danny, of course,
was delighted. For one thing, it was an honour
to have a policeman ask his help like that.
But most of all he was pleased because he had
begun to thirst for another adventure, and
he was afraid, having had such a glorious
one before, it could never be his luck to have
another. “Poke about his place careful-like,”
the policeman had said. But Danny
found it no easy job. If you crept up at
the back of the house, all the horrid hens
in the long runs began cackling (like the
geese on the Capitol), and if you went up
by the front, a beastly mongrel suddenly
leapt out of his kennel with a yell, and made
a row like several dog fights. This brought
Miss Bulky out of the house, looking as fearsome
as “Mrs. Bung,” of the Happy Family
Cards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>So Danny had to content himself with making
sketches of Mr. Bulky’s footmarks and
bicycle tracks, and taking notes as to what
time he went out and what time he came
in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>It was a glorious Saturday in June. A team
of Cubs had worked hard all the morning and
collected more sacks of waste paper than usual.
They had also made a more than usually
ghastly mess with it in Pack headquarters.
And they had, I am sorry to say, played
“trench warfare” and “bayonet charges”
with last week’s load. They were just going
home, at 1 o’clock, to get dinner and a wash,
before starting out for a long-promised expedition
to the river, when Mr. Fox, the Cubmaster,
arrived on the scene. “My word,”
he said, “what a frightful mess! It’s a pity
you’ve done that, because the paper has all
to be sorted and packed this afternoon, ready
to be called for very early on Monday morning.
I had hoped you would have got on
with it this morning. Now I’m afraid I shall
have to tell off three boys for the job this
afternoon.”</p>
<p>“But, sir, we are going to the river this
afternoon,” they said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Fox, “that’s just why it was
a pity you were such little asses as to upset
the sacks already packed, and not have got
on with to-day’s sorting. Three boys must
stay behind and do the work, and when they
have done, they can follow on.”</p>
<p>Someone murmured something sulky about
its not being fair. Someone else said he would
do it to-morrow. “No,” said Mr. Fox, “to-morrow’s
Sunday, remember.” “Who’s got
to stay, sir?” asked Danny, thinking how cool
the river would be this afternoon, and how
nice tea in the old punt would be after a swim.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox looked at the team. “Well,” he
said, “judging by the filthy condition of your
face, young Danny, I should think you’d done
a lot of rolling about in the ‘trenches’ yourself.
You might have known better, being a
Sixer. You must be one. Then this Second,
here, is the next dirtiest; you’ve had your
play, so it’s only fair you should have the
clearing up. And Ginger hasn’t had a fatigue
for a long time! I shall expect the waste paper
properly packed, and all the newspaper sorted
from it and tied in bundles, and this hut quite
clean and ready for Sunday.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>In a chastened mood the team went home
to dinner. They knew Mr. Fox was in the
right, so there was nothing to grumble about.</p>
<p>At 2 o’clock the Pack went off, towels round
necks, and a cheery whistle to keep everyone
in step. Three sorrowful Cubs watched them
go, and then turned into the hut to face a hot
and dirty job.</p>
<p>Thicker and thicker flew the dust. “Talk
about germs,” said Danny; “it’s all very well
to teach us hygiene, and then ask us to swallow
germs by the pound.”</p>
<p>“Waste paper!” said Ginger, “I call it just
dust-bins.”</p>
<p>“There are more sacks than usual this
week,” said Danny.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Philip, the Second of the
Blacks. “We got one from old Bulky’s.
They won’t generally give us any paper, but
we saw his servant carrying it down to the
rubbish heap. She said she had orders to
burn every scrap herself. But we got her to
give it to us.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>“Oh,” said Danny, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I vote we don’t open any of those sacks,”
said Ginger. “Mr. Fox won’t ever know they
weren’t sorted. It would save heaps of time.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>“It wouldn’t be fair,” said Danny. “He’s
trusted us to do it—we must do it properly.
Besides, we get more money if it’s properly
sorted, and we want that twenty quid for
the window.” And so an argument began.
Everybody was hot when it started, but they
got hotter and hotter. Ginger said he would
not do a stroke of work unless Danny agreed
not to sort the sacks that were not open. Philip
was so offensive that Danny had to smack his
head for him. And so it happened that these
two young slackers departed for home and
tea, and Danny found himself faced with the
entire job alone. At first he thought he
would chuck it up and go home, too. Then
he decided not to “give in to himself.” And
finally he remembered that every minute he
worked he was serving the Holy Child, by
earning money for the window, and he began
to take a delight in getting as hot as possible,
and almost relished the mouthfuls of dust he
had to swallow. He battled with the sacks
with the ardour of a Crusader fighting for the
great cause, and suffered the discomfort in
the spirit of a martyr. And when he came to
the last sack, he was truly rewarded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>It was long past tea time, for sorting the
paper unaided was a long job. But Danny
was determined he would not leave the hut
until he had completely finished the job, and
got the place swept clean and the room arranged
for Sunday. It would be a surprise
for the boys and Mr. Fox to-morrow morning,
for he knew the Pack would not be coming
back to headquarters that evening, but would
dismiss in the village and go straight home.
He was nearly tired out by the time he got to
the last sack. Untying the string, he emptied
the dusty contents on the floor, and picked
out the newspaper, waste paper, and cardboard.
He was about to shovel back the
waste paper when his eyes fell on a scrap of a
torn letter covered with curious writing that
was certainly not English; the very characters
were different. Picking it up, he looked at it
carefully. Yes, they were the same funny
characters as those on many of the letters
that had been found in the possession of the
German spies he had caught last autumn.
“A German letter!” he said, “in one of our
sacks! Of course ... Philip said they had
got a sack from old Bulky. This is a clue;
or rather it will be a strong piece of evidence
if I can find the whole letter.” Eagerly he
bent down and began searching about in the
pile of waste paper. But it was at that moment
that he heard the outer gate click and steps
coming along the path. Glancing through
the window, he saw to his dismay that it was
the very last person in the world he wanted
to see just then. It was Mr. Bulky!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3>III
<br>THE LOCKED DOOR</h3>
<p>When Danny saw Mr. Bulky coming down
the path, he thought quick as lightning, and
decided what to do, at once. Stepping out of
the door, he slammed it after him, so that it
locked itself. (The key was in his pocket.)
Then he pretended he was off home, and, putting
on his cap, began walking down the path
towards Mr. Bulky.</p>
<p>“Evening, sir,” he said as he passed. “Hullo,
boy,” said Mr. Bulky. “Why did you come
to my house this morning and take away
my waste paper? I told you I would not
give it to you. You must give me back my
sack at once. Do you hear?” He scowled
angrily.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, sir,” said Danny. “I am
afraid I can’t, this evening. I shall have to
get leave from our Cubmaster. I am sure he
will say yes, and I will bring it back to you on
Monday morning.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>“No,” said the man, “you shall give it to
me now.”</p>
<p>He walked towards the door and tried to
open it. Whilst his back was turned, Danny
took the key from his pocket and flung it into
a patch of young potato plants.</p>
<p>“Give me the key,” said the man, turning
round.</p>
<p>“I haven’t got it on me,” said Danny.</p>
<p>“Little liar,” said the man, and turned out
Danny’s pockets. Then he swore hard, and
gave Danny’s ear a nasty twist. “I promise
to bring you back the sack on Monday,” said
Danny. “Very well,” growled Mr. Bulky,
and he walked out of the gate. Danny
followed him out, and then ran down the
road in the opposite direction till he was
out of sight round the corner. Then he got
through a gap in the hedge and ran back
under cover of it. When he had made
sure that Mr. Bulky was well on his way
home he got back into the garden and found
the key. It was after six, and he still had
a long job before him, so he went back to
tea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>It was past seven when Danny once more
set to work. Taking up every scrap of paper
he examined it carefully. Before long he had
found another scrap covered with the same
writing. He put it in a box with the first.
It was a slow job, but gradually he found more
and more pieces. They fitted together like
a jig-saw puzzle. Luckily they were only
written on one side.</p>
<p>“I know what I’ll do,” said Danny to himself,
“I’ll stick them on a sheet of white
paper, and then when I have them all it will
make a complete letter, and I can take it to
Mr. Bates, as evidence against old Bulky.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>It was getting dark, so he lit the lamp and
drew the curtains across the window. Going
into the Sixers’ room he took the paste pot off
Mr. Fox’s desk, and also a sheet of foolscap
paper. Then, squatting on the ground by the
sack of paper, he laid all the precious pieces
out, fitting them together. Another half-hour’s
search had revealed the rest of the
scraps, and with a wriggle of delight Danny
added the last piece. It made a long letter—nearly
the size of the foolscap sheet. It
was dated and signed, and Danny felt sure it
was in German. Taking the paste brush, he
pasted them all down, making a very neat
job of it.</p>
<p>“Now I must clear up,” he said to himself
as he knelt up admiring his work. “It must
be jolly late.”</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="./Danny Again_ a Project Gutenberg eBook_files/p033.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="695">
<p class="caption">“His eyes met a pair of watching eyes fixed on him through the
crack of the curtains”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>He glanced up at the curtained windows to
see if any light showed through the cracks, or
if it was quite dark, and his heart seemed to
stop, and then go on at a furious pace. His
eyes had met full a pair of watching eyes fixed
on him through the cracks of the curtains.
The glimpse he had caught of the eyes and
white face filled him with fear—but he was
a born Scout, a true wolf of the jungle. He
dropped his eyes again immediately to the
letter, and pretended he had seen nothing.
Not by a tremor did he give away that he
knew he was being watched. Taking up the
letter he fixed his eyes on it as if he were trying
to read it, and while his heart beat like a
hammer against his sides he thought quickly
what he must do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The man was Mr. Bulky, of course. He had
come back to try and break into the hut, and
seeing the light had looked through the window.
He had watched Danny paste his
letter on the paper. He had seen the complete
letter. He knew exactly what Danny was up
to. Why was he waiting there so quietly?
He was waiting for Danny to come out, with
the precious letter on him. He would then
kidnap him, and take away the letter, and
keep him a prisoner, so that he could not give
any information to the police. What on
earth should he do? The one thing he must
be careful about was not to let the man suspect
he had seen him. And so, making a very
great effort, he managed to compose himself
completely, not allowing his hand so much as
to tremble, and even managing to raise a
cheerful whistle. He folded the letter and
put it in the back pocket of his shorts, and
then set to work clearing up. This gave him
time to think. He shovelled back the paper
into the sack. He went into the Sixers’ room
and tidied that. He came back and swept
the floor. He dared not look at the window,
but he felt that the watching eyes were fixed
upon him, like those of a tiger crouching in
the darkness ready to spring on its prey.</p>
<p>As he worked he thought and thought.
The man was guarding the door, and there
was no hope of getting out of any of the windows,
for he could see them all. In the little
inner room there were no windows, it was
lighted by a skylight. Of course it would be
possible to climb up through this on to the
roof, and then drop on to the ground; but
the ground was covered with new gravel, and
the man would be certain to hear; also there
was no way out of the garden except by the
gate guarded by Mr. Bulky, for it would be
impossible to get over the high fence without
making a noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The tidying up of the room was finished.
If he stayed there much longer the man would
begin to suspect that he had been seen. Besides
it was getting very late.</p>
<p>Suddenly an intense feeling of horror came
over Danny. He was like a rat in a trap.
The moments were slipping by; those silent
eyes were watching; before long something
must happen, and he was too far from any
house to be heard if he shouted for help. His
heart began to sink, and then, suddenly, just
as if his Guardian Angel had whispered in his
ear, a splendid idea came to him, which quickly
unfolded itself into a scheme by which he felt
sure he would be able to escape, himself, and
take the spy prisoner, as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>But if his plan was to succeed it was most
important that he should know if Mr. Bulky
was alone, or if he had an accomplice. Also,
exactly where he was. Going into the Sixers’
room Danny took his boots off, then climbing
on to the top of the bookcase, softly opened
the skylight, and drew himself up on to the
roof. Creeping along the tiles as silently as a
cat, he peered down through the darkness.
There, sure enough, stood Mr. Bulky, exactly
outside the door of the hut. He was alone.</p>
<h3>IV
<br>A GERMAN SAUSAGE</h3>
<p>Creeping softly back, Danny let himself
down through the skylight once more. Whistling
loudly, he went into the big room, just to
show that he was there, and, taking up the
spare bundles of newspapers, pretended to be
putting them away in the other room. This
he did simply to put the man off his guard, if
he was still watching through the crack in
the curtains. Then, while the spy imagined
he was packing away the papers in the Sixers’
room, he began to make his arrangements for
capturing Mr. Bulky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>First of all he took the two trek cart ropes,
and making them into coils slipped them round
his arm. Then from the week-end camp cupboard
he took the large travelling rug belonging
to Mr. Fox. It was heavy and cumbersome,
and climbing out of the skylight with it was no
easy job, but somehow Danny managed to do
it and to get along the roof until once more
he was exactly over the head of Mr. Bulky.</p>
<p>The great moment had come. If only the
spy did not chance to look up all would be
well. Balancing himself carefully, Danny
stood up and opened wide the folds of the
heavy rug. Then with great care he flung it
completely over the figure of the man below,
at the same time jumping down himself
straight on to the smothered head of the terrified
Mr. Bulky, and knocking him down like
a ninepin. Hopelessly tangled in the rug,
Mr. Bulky’s struggles were of no avail.
Danny, kneeling on his chest, quickly wound
one of the ropes about his feet, and secured it
with a clove-hitch. The other rope he wound
round and round the unhappy man’s body
and arms, finishing up with a bow-line round
his neck, so that his struggles only made
matters worse for him. The language of Mr.
Bulky was probably very strong, but fortunately
his mouth was so full of rug that Danny
did not understand a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>As he stood there in the semi-darkness,
Danny could not help laughing. Mr. Bulky
looked so exactly like a chrysalis; he curled
about just as they do when you hold them
in your warm hand, or poke them with your
finger. But what to do with the chrysalis
was more than he could decide. At last an
idea struck him: he would cart him off to the
police station in the trek cart!</p>
<p>With some difficulty he managed to put
together the cart, and then with much hauling
and pushing, and the help of a strong plank,
he managed to hoist the bundle that was Mr.
Bulky into the cart. Then, whistling a cheerful
tune, he trundled it down the road towards
Mr. Bates’s house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Mr. Bates was just helping Mrs. Bates
wash up when Danny knocked at his door.
He came out in his shirt-sleeves, a large carving
fork in his hand. “Hello, Danny,” he
said, “what brings you here so late?”</p>
<p>“I have come,” said Danny with a tone of
high importance in his voice, “to deliver into
your hands a document, written in German,
and found in the possession of Mr. Bulky.”</p>
<p>The constable gasped.</p>
<p>“Here it is,” said Danny, handing him the
letter.</p>
<p>Mr. Bates examined it carefully. “That’s
German, sure enough,” he said, trying to read
it aloud, and only succeeding in making a
series of noises very much like his old sow.
Danny laughed. “Well,” said Mr. Bates,
“how did you get this? Old Bulky don’t
know you’ve got it, do ’e?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Danny, “he knows I have got
it. And what’s more, he knows I have brought
it to you.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Mr. Bates said something strong. “That’s
done it,” he added. “He’ll be gone away to
London by now, and no more shall we see of
him. Couldn’t you have managed to let me
know quicker?”</p>
<p>Danny was chuckling to himself.</p>
<p>“I knew you’d be disappointed when I told
you, so I’ve brought you something in the
trek cart to cheer you up.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bates grunted. He did not sound very
grateful.</p>
<p>“Come and see,” said Danny. Mr. Bates
walked up to the trek cart and looked at the
bundle. He gave it a poke with his carving
fork, whereupon the bundle emitted a yell of
pain and a torrent of German abuse. Mr.
Bates, frightened out of his wits, was half
across his little garden in one bound.</p>
<p>“What is it?” he asked, wiping the perspiration
from his brow.</p>
<p>“Only Mr. Bulky,” said Danny, doubled
up with laughter. “You’ve hurt him, I’m
afraid, with your fork.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Mr. Bates, still half afraid of the uncanny
bundle in the trek cart, drew near, somewhat
gingerly. Then, as the situation dawned on
him, he gave vent to a roar of laughter like a
bull. He laughed so much that he had to sit
down on a seat. At last he got up and went
over to the trek cart.</p>
<p>“I think we had better take this ’ere German
sausage to the police station, just as
it is,” he said. “I don’t fancy opening it
myself.”</p>
<p>So together Danny and Mr. Bates trundled
the cart the two miles into the little country
town, and made over its contents to the inspector
who also laughed.</p>
<p>And Danny went home that night feeling
that he had done a good day’s work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>The cheque he received for his good work
more than paid for the new window in the
Cubs’ chapel; and by Danny’s special request
an Angel was put into the picture by the artist,
because Danny was quite sure it was his
Guardian Angel who had whispered to him
the suggestion how he could escape, when he
had given up hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Christmas Eve</span></h2>
<p>It was to be a particularly jolly Christmas
in Danny’s home this year, for his soldier
uncle was going to be there, and two or three
little cousins. His mother had made some
big plum puddings; the house was decorated
with holly and mistletoe; and, to put the final
touch of perfection, it was snowing, and the
boys would be able to make a snow man on
Christmas afternoon. Danny was very happy—all
seemed perfect. But on the morning of
Christmas Eve a letter came by post that
altered things. The letter was from Danny’s
Uncle Bill. It was a sad letter. It told how
Bill and his wife, who had looked forward to
a happy Christmas, would have a dull and
sad one. Their son, expected home from Germany,
could not get leave. They had both
been so ill with influenza that Bill had not
been able to work, and was therefore terribly
hard up; and his wife had been unable to go
out and buy anything to make Christmas jolly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Bill was a woodcutter, and lived in a little
tiny old cottage on the edge of a wood, about
five miles from Danny’s home. As Danny
listened to his mother reading the letter aloud a
thought came into his mind. At first he tried
to send it away, and not to see it, but a voice
within him said, “You’re a Cub, and when
good ideas come to you, you ought not to tell
them to go away. It is giving in to yourself.
If you are selfish, you will not enjoy your
Christmas.” So Danny let the thought come
back, and presently he told it to his mother.</p>
<p>“Mother,” he said, “will you pack up some
nice things in a basket? Then I will start off
after breakfast, and walk over to poor Uncle
Bill’s. And I’ll decorate up all their house
with holly, and go and do shopping for Aunt
Bridget, and then I’ll spend Christmas with
them, and try and cheer them up and make
them forget they’re disappointed ’cos Ted
hasn’t come home.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Danny’s mother was surprised. “You’re
a good boy to think of it,” she said. “But
have you forgotten the Cubs’ party on Christmas
evening?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Danny, “I haven’t forgotten
it.” He stuck his hands in his pockets and
whistled, to pretend he didn’t mind at all
about missing the Christmas party, where all
his fellow Cubs would be enjoying themselves.
“I’ll be sorry to miss Uncle Jim,” he said.
“Tell him so, mother, won’t you? And keep
me a bit of plum pudding. But I must go
and cheer up poor Uncle Bill.”</p>
<p>And so half an hour later he started off to
tramp the long five miles, a kit-bag full of good
things slung over his shoulder. The snowflakes
fell soft and white, and the feeling of
Christmas was in the air. And Danny was
very happy—far happier than he had expected
to be this Christmas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>As he tramped along the snowy roads he
was thinking of the strange story of Uncle Bill,
and the bad luck that had seemed to follow
him.</p>
<p>Bill’s father had been a man who owned a
good deal of property, and a very clever man
too, able to earn much money. But from
boyhood he had been a miser. His one
thought had been to earn gold and then store
it away in secret, and count it up and gloat
over it; but never spend more than he possibly
could help, and never, never give any away.
And so he brought up his children in rags,
and often they had to go hungry and barefoot.
He sold his property, to get more gold,
and lived in a miserable little house by a
wood. At last his three boys, tired of this
wretched life, ran away from home and went
to sea. Two of them were drowned, and Bill
found himself the only remaining member
of his family, with the exception of his sister,
Danny’s mother, who had married and left
home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>When Bill was twenty-one he received a
message saying that his father was dead, and
that all the gold he had amassed during his
life would now belong to his son. So, feeling
he was a very rich man, he married a nice girl
from the little Irish seaport where he was
staying, and returned home as quickly as
possible. But when he reached his native
village he learnt the bad news that the miser
had died without leaving any will, and had
hidden his gold so well that no one could find
it. All that poor Bill inherited was a little
old cottage and a woodcutter’s ax.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to make the
best of a bad job, and settle down in the little
house and become a woodcutter. And so Bill
and his young wife did their best to make a
comfortable home of the old place; but it was
a hard life, and it was difficult always to be
contented when they knew that somewhere
thousands of golden sovereigns lay hidden
that should have belonged to them. One
son was born to them, and now he was nineteen,
and had been fighting in France for the
last year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>It had been a long tramp, but at last Danny
found himself in the wood on the borders of
which was Uncle Bill’s cottage. There was
plenty of lovely holly covered with berries in
this wood; and up in an oak tree Danny saw
some mistletoe. So, putting down his bundle
and taking out his knife, he climbed the tree
and cut down a great bunch of it, and then
filled his arms with holly. He looked like
the very spirit of Christmas as he stood in the
doorway of Uncle Bill’s house, the snow thick
on him, his red muffler making a bright patch of
colour, his arms full of holly and mistletoe, and
a great bulging kit-bag, slung across his back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The little room of the cottage looked dull
and dismal. Only a tiny fire burned feebly
in the great open fireplace. Bill and his wife,
looking pale and ill, sat one each side, in
silence. But Danny’s appearance seemed
to work a miracle. He had brought the spirit
of youth to the house. Before long they were
all laughing. He and Uncle Bill were putting
up holly above the pictures, and hanging the
mistletoe in the chimney-corner. And Bridget
was unpacking the kit-bag. Before long
Danny had been out and chopped some logs,
so that a fire was roaring and crackling up
the chimney, and sending sparks flying like
fire-fairies.</p>
<p>“This is something like Christmas,” said
Uncle Bill, as they sat down to a good dinner
from what Danny had brought, though the
plum pudding and mince pies were being kept
for Christmas Day.</p>
<p>After dinner Danny started off for the
village to buy the things Aunt Bridget needed.
By the time he had finished his shopping and
was starting back again for the woodcutter’s,
the sun had set, in a glory of red, beyond
the snowy trees, and blue dusk was quickly
closing in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>As Danny passed the last house in the
village he was surprised to see a figure standing
in the garden. He had noticed this house
before, as he passed, and had seen that it
stood empty, the windows shuttered, the doors
locked, and everything deserted. Coming
nearer, he looked curiously at the figure. It
was that of a very, very old man, thin and
bent, with a long white beard, and long white
hair. He was shaking his head and talking
to himself in a most sorrowful voice.</p>
<p>“A sorry thing, a sorry thing,” he was saying,
“to be gone eighty year old and never a
corner to lay your head on Christmas Eve.”</p>
<p>Danny stopped, filled with pity for the
aged man.</p>
<p>“Hullo, grandad!” he said, “is there anything
I can do for you?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The old man shook his head mournfully.
“Nay, nay,” he said, “I be eighty year old,
and I’ve walked nine mile to spend Christmas
with me gran’son, and now I come to his
house and find it empty. I haven’t got nowhere
to lay me head this night, and not a
penny to pay for a lodging. It’s dying of
cold I’ll be, a-lying in a ditch all night.” And
he took out a big red handkerchief from his
pocket and began to wipe his eyes.</p>
<p>It was too sad to think of this! Somehow
a happy Christmas must be provided for this
old man, so pathetically like Father Christmas
himself! Danny knew the charitable
spirit that Uncle Bill always showed, and the
warm, generous heart of his Irish aunt, and so
he felt sure they would welcome this poor old
stranger.</p>
<p>“Come home with me, grandad,” he said,
“you’ll find a roaring log fire, and an armchair
in the chimney corner, and to-morrow you
shall eat Christmas pudding.”</p>
<p>The old man looked almost dazed with surprise.
He peered closer at Danny. “Is it a
Christmas fairy you are, out of the wood?”
he said in a whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>This was splendid, to be taken for a fairy!
“Yes,” said Danny, laughing; and taking the
aged man’s cold, gnarled old hand, he led
him through the wood to his uncle’s house.</p>
<p>“Shure,” cried his aunt as she opened the
door. “I do believe he’s afther bringing us
Faither Christmas himself.”</p>
<p>Danny soon explained, and Bill and Bridget
gave the old stranger a warm welcome. “They
do say,” exclaimed Bridget, “that if you welcome
a stranger on Christmas Eve, he may
be an Angel.”</p>
<p>“’Tain’t no Angel as I be,” said the old
man, shaking his head. And then he laughed,
and he had little, twinkling eyes. “If there
be an Angel about, ’tis yourself, or the boy
here.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Every one was hungry that night, and supper
was a cheery meal. But after supper
came the time Danny longed for. The lamp
was put out (to save the oil), and the bright,
dancing firelight glowed in the quaint little
room, with its crooked beams and uneven
floor. In the deep chimney-corner, one on
each side, sat Bill and Bridget, and enthroned
in the large armchair before the fire sat the
ancient stranger, puffing contentedly at a long
clay pipe. Danny was curled up on the
rabbit-skin rug. “Now,” he said, his eyes
dancing with expectation, “now for stories.”</p>
<p>So, to the accompaniment of crackles from
the logs, Bill recounted many a strange and
thrilling yarn of his sailor days. At last he
was silent.</p>
<p>“Grandad,” said Danny, turning to the
ancient stranger, “will you tell us a story?
A mysterious one. I’m sure there were fairies
and hobgoblins when you were a boy, long,
long ago. Or, do you know a ghost story?”</p>
<p>The old man nodded his head. “Yes,” he
said, “there were fairies, sure enough, when
I was a boy. But I was not a good enough
boy to see them. But a hobgoblin I did see,
once. ’Twas on just such a night as this—Christmas
Eve, with snow on the ground,—and
’twas but a stone’s throw from this very
house.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>This was splendid! Danny turned round
and fixed his eyes on the old man’s face.
“Tell us, tell us,” he whispered.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>“I was born in this here village,” he said,
“and here I married a lass. And here my son
was born. And ’twas on his first Christmas
he fell ill of the croup. Very near death he
was, and my wife begged me to run fast as I
could to fetch the doctor. The shortest way
was through this here wood, and though I was
afeared something terrible of the little people
as might come after me in the dark, still for
love of the boy I came this way.</p>
<p>“’Twas moonlight, and, as I reached the end
of the wood, just about outside of this house,
I breathed again with relief. But too soon—for
when I got to the Druids’ Oak (you know
it, for sure—that big old oak, the last of the
wood), I saw a hobgoblin.”</p>
<p>The old man made an impressive pause.</p>
<p>Danny was gazing at him, round-eyed.
“What was it like?” he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>“’Twas dressed all in a black cloak, with a
hood over its head, and it had a great bag on
its back. It was up in the Druids’ Oak, and
just before I got to it, it dropped to the ground,
light as a feather, and ran quickly into the
shadows. I was half mad with fear, and,
calling on the saints to protect me, I ran and
never stopped till I reached the doctor’s house.
That story is true, by all that’s holy. I swear
’tis true.”</p>
<p>“How big was the hobgoblin?” asked
Danny.</p>
<p>“Near as big as you,” said the old man.
“I thought they was smaller, so it frightened
me the more.</p>
<p>“I told the story to one and another in the
village, and some laughed at me, but one or
two, very solemn-like, told me they had seen
that hobgoblin, too. They said that ’twas
very lucky to see it, but one must not talk of
it to any man. One man told me that the
next day he went by daylight past the same
tree, and in the snow found a gold piece,
which was just what he was sorely needing.
He was sure ’twas the hobgoblin had put it
there for him. And sure enough, my baby
was cured from croup from that time.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>“Do you think the hobgoblin still lives in
the oak?” asked Danny, “and still comes out
on Christmas Eve.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the ancient stranger, “hobgoblins
live for five hundred years. This one is
still in the oak as likely as not. And they
used to say he always comes out on Christmas
Eve.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” cried Danny. “I wish I could see
him! Perhaps he would bring luck to Uncle
Bill.”</p>
<p>The great log fire was beginning to burn low.
The ancient stranger was beginning to nod.
The church clock struck ten through the stillness
of the clear night, while the earth slept
beneath its counterpane of snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>“Time to turn in,” said Bill. He took the
aged stranger and led him to the little room
that would have been Danny’s, but which
Danny had insisted should be given to the
stranger, saying he could sleep very well on
the rabbit-skin rug before the fire.</p>
<p>“I think I shall go and look for the hobgoblin,”
said Danny.</p>
<p>“’Tis foolishness you are talking, child,”
said Bridget. “There do be no hobgoblins in
this country. If you must be afther getting
good luck for me and your oncle, go to midnight
Mass and pray for us! ’Tis more likely
ye will get what ye do be wantin’ there than
from hobgoblins.”</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>But when all was still and the stranger was
snoring, and the line of yellow light under Bill
and Bridget’s door had vanished, Danny got
softly up from the skin before the fire, and
put on his cap and coat and muffler, took
down a lantern from the wall, and put a box
of matches in his pocket. Then he unbarred
the door, and let himself out into the snowy
night. A few minutes later he was standing
in the shadows, gazing with awe and expectation
at the Druids’ Oak, where it stood, gnarled
and ancient, in the moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>For some time he stood there watching, but
it was very cold, and he grew impatient.
Walking with silent steps over the snow, he
went up to the tree, and laid his hand on the
rough, knobbly trunk. The night was perfectly
still, the moon shone steady and white,
and at that moment the church clock struck
eleven, slowly and clearly. Danny shuddered.
This was the hour for ghosts and hobgoblins
to prowl. The next hour—twelve to one
o’clock—would be the holy hour, when we
remember the birth of the Divine Babe.</p>
<p>The last stroke of eleven had scarcely died
away when there was a scraping, scrabbling
sound from the very heart of the oak, seemingly
coming from beneath Danny’s hand.
He started, and his heart seemed to miss a
beat, and then race on. Something within
him seemed to say “Run, run,” and his legs
almost obeyed, but his will was stronger than
his instinct, and remembering that he was a
Cub and must not give in to himself, he stood
his ground, only drawing a little into the
shadow. He watched the tree intently—was
he at last to see a hobgoblin?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Something black moved in the stumpy
branches, at the top of the thick, low trunk.
Then with a hoot, a great owl floated out, on
soft, silent wings, and flew swiftly away into
the shadows.</p>
<p>Danny breathed hard. For a while he did
not move; then, giving way once more to his
impatience, he went up to the tree.</p>
<p>It was curious that the scraping sound
should have seemed to come from the very
heart of the trunk; it must be a hollow tree,
he told himself. Then that was where the
hobgoblin lived. Perhaps he had changed
himself into an owl, and flown away on his
midnight adventures! An idea suddenly
struck Danny. He would climb the tree,
and see if it was possible to get down into its
hollow inside. He would then find the home
of the hobgoblin, and perhaps the mysterious
door into fairy-land! He lit his lantern and
hooked it on a branch; then climbed up by
the knots which seemed to form little steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Yes, sure enough the tree was hollow.
There was a hole down into its inside just big
enough for a boy to squeeze through. Danny
tied a piece of string to his lantern, and let it
down through the hole. Carefully he lowered
it until at last it rested on the ground. Then
he peered down. To his amazement he found
that a little ladder led down the inside of the
tree!</p>
<p>Without a moment’s hesitation he descended
the ladder. The tree was like a tiny round room
inside, and in the floor at his feet was a hole
with a little, narrow staircase leading down.</p>
<p>Danny pinched himself. Was he dreaming?
No, he was certainly awake. Could this
really be the way into fairy-land? He had
only half believed in the hobgoblin all the
time. But now he began to think it must
really all be true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Taking up his lantern, he carefully descended
the steps, one by one—there were ten of them—and
found himself in a little kind of grotto.
The walls were of earth and full of gnarled
tree roots. The grotto was empty, except
for a rough wooden chest that looked as if
it had been made by someone who was not
a very good carpenter.</p>
<p>With trembling hands Danny raised the lid
and looked in. A number of large leather
bags were ranged, side by side, at the bottom,
and among them was a stout leather book.
Breathing hard, Danny lifted out one of the
bags. It was very heavy. He placed it on
the floor and it chinked. Then he untied the
string, and put his hand in. It was a fistful
of glittering coins that he drew forth!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Suddenly it all flashed into his mind. The
miser and his hidden money—this must have
been his hiding-place! Where the hobgoblin
came in he did not know or care. All that
mattered was that he had found the hidden
treasure that belonged to Uncle Bill, and
would make him a rich man. One by one
Danny lifted out the leather bags. “There
must be thousands of pounds there,” he told
himself. The sovereigns were funny looking
ones, with the head of Queen Victoria when
quite young on them.</p>
<p>Last of all he took out the fat, leather book.
Then, very carefully, he managed to hoist
one bag after another up the tree, and dump
it down on the snow. At last he climbed down
himself.</p>
<p>Very softly he carried his treasure into the
cottage. Looking for somewhere to put the
bags, an idea struck him and he hung them in
a row on the nails in the high mantelshelf,
over the great open hearth. How pleased
Uncle Bill would be: what a wonderful Christmas
surprise!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>And with that thought it struck Danny how
good it was of God to have let him find the
missing money for his uncle. He glanced at
the clock. A quarter to twelve it said. Aunt
Bridget had said he should go to midnight
Mass and pray for their luck to come back.
Now he could do better than that, he could go
and thank God for having given it back!</p>
<p>Putting on his cap once more, he hurried
out along the snowy path, and turned into
the warm, lighted church. Never had he
thanked God so fervently for anything. But
soon he forgot all about the money, in the
wonderful sense of Christmas morning, and
the new realization of the Little Christ born
to be the Brother and the Saviour of men.</p>
<p>Very sleepily he stumbled home, and curled
up on the rug before the red glow of smouldering
logs.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>“How soundly he sleeps,” said Uncle Bill,
the next morning as he lighted the lamp and
bent over Danny. Bridget laughed, and
shook him by the shoulders. Danny opened
his eyes and sat up. His first thought was to
look up at the mantelpiece. Yes, there hung
the bags.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>“Thank God,” he said, “I was afraid it was
a dream.”</p>
<p>Bill and Bridget looked up too. “What
are they?” said Bill, a puzzled expression on
his face, “plum puddings?”</p>
<p>Danny laughed. “No, no,” he said.
“Look!”</p>
<p>He unhooked a bag, and shook out the shining
contents on to the rabbit skin rug. The
sovereigns gleamed and glinted in the lamplight.
Bill and Bridget stood speechless.
Then Danny explained all that had happened.</p>
<p>At last they examined the book.</p>
<p>It was inscribed at the beginning with the
miser’s name, in a little crabbed handwriting.
And there were entries made every Christmas
Eve, beginning with Christmas, 1830. Each
Christmas there was a larger sum to record,
until at last in 1898 was entered £3,100.</p>
<p>“And it’s all yours, uncle,” said Danny,
smacking Bill on the back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Bill’s heart was too full to speak, at first;
but Bridget had plenty to say—all that they
would do with it—all that this would mean for
the boy’s future and their old age.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>The stranger joined them at breakfast.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you he was Father Christmas
or a Holy Angel?” said Bridget. “See what
he has brought us.”</p>
<p>“Nay, ’tis the lad,” said the ancient stranger.
“I said ’e was a fairy. Or, maybe,
’twas the hobgoblin—he always brings luck;
and the owl who flew out of the tree was him,
as likely as not.”</p>
<p>Bill was a pious man, not given to belief in
such things.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, “’twas the Holy Child,
bringing us a Christmas gift, for love of the
boy here, who was willing to give up his happy
Christmas at home to come and cheer up his
poor old uncle.”</p>
<p>“And to give his bed to an old, lonely
stranger,” added the old man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Danny flushed. “No, no,” he said, “it
wasn’t for my sake. But I do think uncle
is right about it being a Christmas present.
I went to midnight Mass to thank for it.”
Aunt Bridget kissed him for the twentieth
time, and Bill cleared his throat, which seemed
rather husky.</p>
<p>“But what about the hobgoblin, really?”
said Danny. “Grandad, here, swears he saw
him; and you see it was true about the Druids’
Oak being a wonderful tree.”</p>
<p>Bill went to a big press in the corner of the
room.</p>
<p>“I think I know who the hobgoblin was.
Come here, son,” he added.</p>
<p>Danny went to him, and behind the door of
the cupboard Uncle Bill arrayed him in an old
black cloak and hood. “Now, hang a bag
over your shoulder, and hurry across the room,
bent-up like, and see if grandad don’t think
he’s seeing his hobgoblin again,” he said.</p>
<p>Danny obeyed, and the old man started
up. “’Tis him, ’tis him!” he said, “the very
same.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p>“My father,” said Bill, “was a very small,
thin, little old man, not much bigger than
Danny. ’Twas him you saw, fetching back
his money on Christmas Eve to count it, and
enter it in his book.”</p>
<p>The old man was nodding his head slowly.</p>
<p>“So, after all I’ve never seen a hobgoblin,”
he said. “I’m eighty year old—I shall die
afore I get another chance.”</p>
<p>“Never mind, grandad,” said Bridget, “ye’ll
be afther seeing the Angels then, so it’ll be
all right.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>
<p>The glorious day had come at last—the day
when Harry and his mother and little sister
were to start on their journey to Switzerland.
They were going out for the whole winter, and
Harry was frightfully excited about it. Fancy
being up 7,000 feet in the mountains, and
seeing nothing but snow, snow, snow, everywhere!
And being able to toboggan and
skate and ski all day! And then the journey—to
cross the Channel, and then go in a train
all day and all night!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>The day had come, and Harry was safely
in the train on his way to Folkestone. Crossing
the Channel was great fun. It was rather
rough, and all the old ladies sat tight in red
wooden chairs, tucked up in stuffy old rugs.
They got greener and greener and looked very
unhappy. But Harry and his little sister
went up on the top deck and ran about and
enjoyed themselves hugely. It was very
hard to walk straight, because the ship rolled
from one side to the other, and you felt just
as a fly on the wall must feel, clinging on
with the soles of your feet.</p>
<p>At last the white cliffs of Dover disappeared,
and there was nothing to be seen but sea and
sky and half a dozen seagulls following the
ship. And then a faint line showed on the
horizon ahead, and it was the coast of France!
Harry and his sister gazed at it, and thought
to themselves that it was the first time in
their lives they had seen a foreign country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>At last the boat steamed into the harbour
at Boulogne. Crowds of funny old French
porters came bustling on board. They were
dressed in loose blue blouses, and they all
talked in French and wrangled with each other
and the passengers, as if they were very angry.
But they weren’t really—it was only their
French way. Harry’s mother managed to
get hold of one, and he collected all her bags
and suit cases and strapped them together on
a long strap, and hung them over his shoulder.
Harry thought to himself that he had never
seen one man carry so many things before.
He barged along through the crowd, shouting
most rudely to make people get out of his way.
He took all the things to a place called the
<i>douane</i>—an awful place full of cross officials,
who opened the boxes and pulled things about.</p>
<p>“What awful cheek!” said Harry. But
his mother explained it was the Customs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>“A rotten custom, I call it, to pry about in
a lady’s private luggage,” said Harry. So his
mother explained it was the duty of the Customs
officers to see that certain things like
food and jewellery and tobacco were not taken
into the country without duty being paid on
them. When the luggage had all been packed
up once again the old French porter, who
walked just like a crab, went crawling off with
his load to the train. It was a funny train—very
high: or, rather, the platform was very
low. At last they were all settled in, and in
about half an hour they started.</p>
<p>Of course Harry and his sister looked out of
the window all the way. It was so exciting
to see France. That was before the days of
the War, and the little villages were still peaceful
and happy, and the rows of stunted willow
trees stood along the straight, flat roads for
miles and miles, like silent sentinels.</p>
<p>On, on rushed the train. At tea time it
was great fun walking along the little wobbly
passages to the dining-car. Then again for
supper. By that time Harry and his sister
were very sleepy. So his mother rang a bell,
and a man came along and pressed a button
and performed a conjuring trick by which the
seats were turned into little white beds, with
sheets and blankets and pillows all complete.
He did another conjuring trick, and a little
bunk was produced from the wall, and Harry
found his bed all ready, a few feet above his
sister’s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>“When you wake up in the morning we shall
be in Switzerland,” said his mother.</p>
<p>They slept beautifully. But every now and
then they woke up to find the train still rushing
on, on, on, in the darkness. Sometimes
it rushed into a station and pulled up. It
seemed to Harry that the engine heaved a
heavy sigh. Then it started on again. It
was nearly six when Harry’s mother woke
them up and told them to dress quickly, because
soon they would be at Bâle. So they
did; and when the train stopped they got
out.</p>
<p>They found themselves in a huge station,
and it was very cold. Their mother got hold
of a porter, and they went along to a big refreshment
room, where they had their first
Swiss breakfast—coffee and funny little rolls,
like half-moons, and honey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>After some time they got into another train,
and travelled on until at last, by the afternoon,
they had got into the real, snowy part of
Switzerland.</p>
<p>Harry had never seen so much snow. But
his mother said it would be even more wonderful
when they got right up among the
mountains to St. Moritz.</p>
<p>At a place called Chur they changed into a
funny little train that began slowly plodding
up the mountain passes.</p>
<p>Here the snow was wonderful. It lay a
yard thick on the mountainside, and was
inches thick on the branches of the fir-trees.
The train went through many tunnels, and
over high, high viaducts; and sometimes
the corners were so sharp that you could look
out of the window and see the tail of your own
train coming round the last curve! The air
was so crisp that it seemed to give you new
life, and you longed to be out snowballing
or doing something active.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The sun went down behind the great white
Alps, and the snow began to look a bright
bluish purple in the dusk. And before long
it was quite dark.</p>
<p>“We shall soon be there, now,” said Harry’s
mother.</p>
<p>After stopping at several little stations the
train steamed into St. Moritz at last, and
everybody got out.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>As they stepped out of the station it was
like walking into fairy-land. Snow, snow,
everywhere—snow roads, with sleighs on
them, drawn by horses with jingling bells on
their harness. Through the clear, still blue
night, shimmered and glittered a thousand
little points of light from the many, many
windows of all the big hotels, and from the
little windows of the chalets, clinging to the
hillside, or crowding down on the edge of the
great frozen lake. Above, the stars shone
larger and brighter than Harry had ever seen
them before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>It was freezing hard, but somehow no one
seemed to feel cold. Everybody was dressed
in woolly garments—white sweaters and coloured
mufflers and woolly caps. And everybody
seemed to be laughing. Some were
pulling toboggans home, others carrying
skates, or shouldering their skis. Harry and
his little sister began to laugh, too, and ran
out on the snow. But soon they fell down,
and found out that they must be careful how
they walked until they had spiky nails fixed
in their boots.</p>
<p>They were to stay in a lovely, big hotel, up
the hill. Jumping into an open sleigh, they
drove briskly along, gliding smoothly over
the snow, their bells making a merry jingle
on the frosty air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>That night they slept very soundly, and
the next morning they hastened to look out
of the window. All was a dazzling white,
and the sky was bluer than they had imagined
it could be. They dressed quickly in woolly
clothes, and put on rubber boots, called “gouties”
to stop them slipping; and as soon as
they had breakfasted, they went out, and
down the little village street.</p>
<p>Tobogganing was the one thing in the world
Harry wanted to do. He had already made
friends with some very nice boys at the Kulm
Hotel, who told him it was the best sport
going. So his mother hired a toboggan for
him, and he went down to the village run,
where he found his friends. They soon
showed him how to do it.</p>
<p>The run was like a long curly path, made of
hard snow and ice, and very steep. If you
wanted to go really fast you took a run, pushed
off your toboggan with a final kick, and threw
yourself flat on your tummy upon it. As
you rushed along you shouted to make everybody
clear out of your light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Harry had a few falls at first, of course, and
got a few scrapes and bruises; but every day
he would go at it, until, before long, he became
the fastest “rider” on the run, and people
would clear out of his way pretty quick when
they heard him coming.</p>
<p>One day some men he knew at the hotel
said he tobogganed so well that they would
take him with them on a real, proper toboggan
run, all made of ice, called the Dimson Run.
Harry was delighted. Tobogganing, here,
really was some sport, and rather dangerous
too, for the run was very steep, and you went
at a tremendous rate. Though he was the
youngest rider on the run, he won a silver cup
in one of the races!</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>It was during Harry’s last week at St. Moritz
that a great adventure befell him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>His best pal at the Kulm Hotel was his
uncle, a very cheery young man, much admired
by everyone, for he was the champion of the
Cresta Run—the greatest toboggan run in the
world. Tobogganing on the Cresta is serious
work. Not very many people belong to the
Cresta Club, and are allowed to do it. The
run is wonderfully made. It is nearly a mile
long, and full of dips and twists and turns. It
is all made of the smoothest, most shining ice;
and the riders, lying face downwards on their
heavy, steel toboggans, go down at the speed
of an express train. The smallest mistake
in leaning the wrong way, or taking a corner
too fast, and they would be thrown over the
banks, and perhaps killed! To round the
corners at such a high speed they have to run
round right up on the curved wall of ice, which
is made the right shape on purpose. These
corners are given different names. The two
biggest banks, on a part of the run which
looks like a big “S,” are called “Battledore”
and “Shuttlecock,” because the rider seems
to be thrown across from one bank to the
other, rather like a shuttlecock in the game.
If they are not very careful, “Battledore”
throws them right out over the side, and they
fall down about twelve feet into a pile of snow!
There are very exciting races on the Cresta.
The biggest one is called the Grand National.
Crowds and crowds of people come to watch
it, and the winner is quite a hero.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>When Harry was not tobogganing himself
on the smaller runs, his great delight was to
come and watch Uncle Hugh practising. He
would watch him pass like a flash, his runners
making a roaring sound on the ice. Then he
would ask the timekeeper how many seconds
Uncle Hugh had taken—for each rider is
“timed” each time he goes down, to the tenth
of a second—and he would run down and tell
Uncle Hugh his time (fifty-nine seconds, perhaps),
and walk up with him, while an old
Italian followed behind, pulling up his “bus”
as he called his toboggan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>At last the great day of the Grand National
had come. Harry, standing in a huge crowd,
watched the different riders tear past. Oh,
how he hoped Uncle Hugh would win! The
riders had to go down three times. Each
time one got to the bottom a man with a megaphone
(or speaking trumpet) called out his
time. They had all gone down three times, and
the great moment came for the winner to be
called out. Harry’s heart beat fast. Hooray!
It was Uncle Hugh. He felt very proud to be
the nephew of the hero; and he rushed down
the snowy path to meet him. It was then
that he suddenly felt quite sure that if only
he were allowed to, <i>he</i> could ride the Cresta!</p>
<p>That evening, in the hotel, he asked Uncle
Hugh if he would get leave for him to go down
just once. Hugh laughed kindly.</p>
<p>“You’re too young, kid,” he said. “Why
you’re only twelve! It’s not very easy, you
know. You’d probably have a bad crash and
kill yourself.”</p>
<p>Some people standing near had heard. They
burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“Do you hear that?” said one of the ladies,
“Harry thinks he can ride the Cresta on the
strength of his uncle having won the Grand
National!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Everyone laughed, and poor Harry blushed
to the roots of his hair. He said nothing, for
he knew he <i>could</i> ride the Cresta, if only
they would give him the chance, and he determined,
inside, that he <i>would</i> manage to go
down, somehow, and show them he could.</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>The next day a small friend of his, Phil,
told him something that filled him with delight.
The Cresta was closed for that season, for one
of the banks was considered too weak, and it
would be impossible to rebuild it, for the thaw
was beginning to set in. This meant that all
the bars would be taken away, and the run
left to thaw, and that all the little boys from
the village would come and slide about on it,
and soon spoil its beautiful, smooth surface.
It also meant that there was now nothing to
stop any one who liked taking a toboggan, and
going down the whole course!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>“I’ll tell you a secret, Phil,” said Harry.
“To-morrow morning, before any one is up,
I am going to go down the Cresta from the
top. You can come with me, and we’ll get
Dick and Reggie to come too, as witnesses to
prove I can do it, and teach those rotters not
to laugh.”</p>
<p>Phil was delighted at the prowess of his
friend. “What if you get killed?” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh, then it will prove that I couldn’t do
it, and they were right!” said Harry.</p>
<p>At 8.30 the next morning, just as the sun
peeped over the snowy mountains, Harry, with
knee and elbow pads, and “rakes” (or spikes)
fixed on his toes, crept out, dragging a heavy toboggan.
He was followed by his three friends.
They walked down by the run first. Every bar
had been taken away, it was clear and free.</p>
<p>“Now for it!” said Harry, as he stood at the
top, his heart beating fast with excitement.
Lying flat on his toboggan, he slid off down the
first incline, down towards the steep and
sudden dip called “Church Leap.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>At this moment his friends saw a tall figure
walking down the path by the run, away by
the big corners known as “Battledore” and
“Shuttlecock.” In a moment they recognized
him by his orange scarf—it was Uncle Hugh!
He had stopped, for he had heard the rush of
a toboggan on the run. What would he say
when he saw it was Harry? But even as they
saw him stop, they saw something else that
made their blood run cold!</p>
<p>At the place where the run cuts across the
road, and is usually guarded by a man with a
red flag to keep people from crossing, a wood
sleigh suddenly appeared. It advanced slowly
and drew up, the horse standing straight across
the run. Once a rider has started down the
Cresta Run there is no way of stopping—he
must rush on at sixty miles an hour! The
three boys’ hearts seemed to stop with terror.
Hugh was standing still, his eyes fixed on the
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>And what of Harry? Long as this takes to
tell, it was all a matter of less than a minute.
Harry had rushed in a glorious, thrilling whirl
down most of the run—the worst was over.
He was now on the long steep <i>straight</i>, and
there were only small corners to get round.
The cold air seemed to whistle in his face and
make his eyes stream, for he was travelling
at a very high speed. And then—then he
saw the terrible sight. A horse and sleigh
was standing across the run!</p>
<p>There were only a few seconds to think
what to do as he flew onwards. But Harry
did not lose his head. At one glance he had
noticed that the <i>horse</i> and not the <i>sleigh</i> was
across the run. The driver was round at the
back, fixing up a log that had slipped. Lying
very flat, and guiding himself straight as an
arrow, Harry kept his course, and passed like
a flash beneath the horse, between his four
great legs! He was safe!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The three boys, watching from the top,
threw their caps in the air, and cheered and
laughed for joy! Hugh, standing by “Shuttlecock,”
his teeth clenched, gave a sigh of relief.
“Thank God!” he said. “Thank God! He’s
a sporting kid, right enough, and he’s got some
wits to have done that—it was his only chance!”</p>
<p>No one at the hotel laughed when they
heard the story. Harry was thoroughly
scolded, of course. But everyone looked at
him with admiration. “Some day he’ll be
the champion on the Cresta,” said an old
Colonel, who had won the Grand National
many years ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">A Midnight Adventure</span></h2>
<p>Wolf Cub Pat Shannon awoke with a start,
and sat up in bed. He had been far away in
the glorious land of dreams, driving a Rolls-Royce
motor car. It must have been the
happy week he had spent since Christmas,
riding on his scooter, that had made him
dream this, for his Uncle Patrick had brought
him a scooter from London for a Christmas
present. It was a real beauty, with solid
rubber tires and nice big wheels, and it had
cost 7s. 6d.! Pat had learned to get up a
tremendous speed upon it.</p>
<p>“Shure, it’s a danger ye are to the pedestrians!”
his uncle had said one day, on meeting
him rushing down the street of the little Irish
town where he lived. Pat had not a notion
what a <i>pedestrian</i> was; all he knew was that
it made his uncle buy him a real bicycle bell
and screw it on the handle of his scooter!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Now he had been suddenly roused from his
dreams. He sat up in the darkness and
listened. Yes, it was his mother’s voice. She
was sitting up, he knew, with baby, who had
bronchitis. He was the only man in the
house, his father being at the front with his
regiment, the Royal Irish Fusiliers. He had
wanted to sit up, but his mother had told him
to go to bed, and she would call if she wanted
help. Now he heard her.</p>
<p>“Pat—Pat—Patrick Michael!” Her voice
seemed somehow frightened.</p>
<p>“Yes, mother!” he called, scrambling out
of bed. In a moment he was pattering down
to the kitchen, barefooted, in his little nightshirt.</p>
<p>“Pat,” said his mother, “Baby’s very ill,
he is. He’s after takin’ a sudden turn for
the worse. I must have the doctor this
minute, or it’s dead he’ll be before morning.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>“Right, mother,” said Pat in a business-like
way. “If the doctor is at his house, I’ll
have him here in half an hour!”</p>
<p>He ran upstairs again. In three minutes he
was back dressed and searching in the back
kitchen for his scooter.</p>
<p>“What d’you be after fetchin’, dearie?”
said his mother. “Sure, an’ you aren’t goin’
to take out yer scooter this dark night?”</p>
<p>“Yes, mother,” said Pat. “It’s as fast as
a motor bike, I can be goin’ on my scooter.
I shall be down the hill at the doctor’s house
in ten minutes from now.”</p>
<p>Softly he let himself out, and set off down
the lonely road. There was a small moon,
and he knew every inch of the way.</p>
<p>It was all down hill to the doctor’s house.
The road was smooth and quite empty. Pat
got up a great speed. It was glorious! The
night air rushed past him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>He reached the bottom of the first hill. There
was rather a lonely piece of road to go along,
here. At the end of it stood a great house,
with a high wall round it. The owner of the
house had been away from it for many years.
Only a very old caretaker lived in it.</p>
<p>People said it was full of treasures and great
wealth—jewels and silver plate, priceless china
and beautiful pictures. The shutters were
always closed, and many were the tales about
it.</p>
<p>Pat’s heart beat rather fast as he reached
the wall. Great black trees grew in the garden
and stretched their branches like great
hands over it.</p>
<p>All the stories he had ever heard of ghosts
and banshees and the “little people” came into
his head. He half wished he hadn’t come.
The shadows were so very black, and all was
so still. There was no one about, and not
the faintest sound to be heard.</p>
<p>“A Cub does not give in to himself.” The
words of the Cub Law suddenly came into
his head. He felt the little brass badge in his
buttonhole, and it gave him courage. With a
kick he sent his scooter on, and passed out of
the moonlight into the shadow of the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Hullo! what was that sound? A noise of
breaking glass and splintering wood, as if someone
had jumped through a window—running
feet in the garden—a hoarse shout—now a
long, shrill blast from a policeman’s whistle—more
running behind the wall—then the
sound of another policeman running down the
road to the help of his comrade!</p>
<p>Pat forgot his fears. Here was a real adventure!</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, just ahead, a dark figure
appeared in the moonlight, crouching on the
top of the wall. A moment later the policeman
had dashed up. Like a tiger springing on
his prey, the man leapt down on him, knocking
him flat, and then began running down
the hill at top speed.</p>
<p>A second policeman had come up, and,
seeing the running figure, made after him.
But it was a hopeless chase. The man had
had a good start, and he was a swift runner.
Besides, the policeman was rather fat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Suddenly a thought flashed into Pat’s mind,
and his heart grew big with courage. He would
help the policeman in his work—that would
be <i>some</i> good turn!</p>
<p>Placing his right foot firmly on his scooter,
he kicked off violently with his left. In a
moment he was shooting like a flash down the
steep hill. It was a dangerous job. He
squatted down and balanced carefully. He
had never been at such a speed in his life.</p>
<p>In half a minute he had overtaken the policeman.
The man, hearing the following footsteps
flagging, had reduced his speed a little.
Pat’s rubber wheels made no sound on the
smooth road. Nearer and nearer he drew to
the flying thief. Now he was very near.
He set his teeth and steered his scooter straight
for the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p><i>Crash!</i> The scooter and its small rider
had hurled themselves against his legs. With
a yell of terror and pain the great figure
crashed to the ground, Pat on top of it, the
scooter flying out into the road. Without
a moment’s hesitation he scrambled free of
the man’s legs, and sat with all his weight on
the furious burglar’s head. The man struggled
violently, but one of his arms was caught
under him, and Pat was bending the other
back in a most painful position. Before long
the policeman was up, and had the prisoner
handcuffed.</p>
<p>Pat felt as if he were one great bruise all
over! Blood was streaming from a cut on
his chin, where it had come into violent contact
with the burglar’s boot. But his first
thought was for baby and the doctor. Picking
up his scooter, he did not wait for a word
from the policeman, but dashed on down the
hill.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Dr. Byrne was up at the
cottage in his car, with Pat and his scooter
on the seat beside him. Of course the cut on
the chin had to be explained. And, when
baby was fixed up, it was stitched and bandaged.
The next day Dr. Byrne drove his
small patient to the Police Court.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Ten pounds reward! Why, the very excitement
of the adventure would have been enough
reward in itself! But, all the same, it’s rather
jolly to have £10 of your very own, earned
by your own pluck and the help of your
scooter!</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">The Secret Room</span></h2>
<h3>I
<br>A FAMILY SECRET</h3>
<p>Eric Stone lived in Westminster with his
aunt, for he had no mother or father. He
belonged to a Westminster Pack, but he spent
all his holidays at his grandfather’s house—a
lovely old castle in Wales. Its weather-beaten
walls reached out very near to the
craggy cliffs, where the sea dashed up, white
and foamy. Of course Eric longed for his
holidays, and one day it struck him how jolly
it would be to take three of the other Cubs
with him. So he got leave from his grandfather,
Sir David Stone, and then he invited
the boys. He did not choose the ones he
liked best, but the three chaps who would be
likely to have the dullest holiday, and no fun
at Christmas. That is how Donald Ford,
number six of the Whites, came to have the
strange adventure this story is about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>It was Christmas Eve. The four Cubs
had decorated the castle with holly and mistletoe.
Now they were curled up on the great
bearskin rug in the hall, before a blazing log
fire. The dark winter afternoon had closed
in, but the lamps were not yet lighted. Everything
looked very mysterious; the fire-light
danced in the dark corners, gleaming on the
shining suits of armour and oak-panelled walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>“Tell us a ghost story,” said one of the
Cubs. So Eric told them all the stories he
knew about the castle, and the knights who
had lived in it hundreds of years ago. “And
now,” he said, “I’ll tell you something which
is not just a story, but is quite true. Somewhere
in this castle there is a <i>secret room</i>.
You know in olden days people used to hide
in secret rooms, away from their enemies.
Well, there’s one here, and it was always kept
very secret: only the head of the family knew
where it was. It opened by a spring, hidden
in the oak panelling. But now nobody knows
where it is; the secret has been quite lost for
four hundred years, because they found it
was very, very unlucky for any one to open
the door or go in; it always meant a tragedy,
or great shame on the family. I should love
to find the room and so would grandfather.
Of course it’s all rot about its being unlucky.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” cried the Cubs, “how awfully exciting!
Do let’s hunt for it.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” agreed Eric, “we will, to-morrow.
There’s one side of the castle we don’t use,
because it is unsafe and may fall to ruins any
day. The servants say that’s where the
secret room is. They wouldn’t go there after
dark for anything. In fact they say they hear
footsteps there in the night.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>At this moment there were steps in the hall
and voices, and Eric’s grandfather came in
accompanied by his adopted son, William
Mendel, a gloomy-looking man. Sir David
Stone was a tall, soldierly looking old man,
and devoted to Eric, for Eric’s father (his
only son) had been killed in the War. William
Mendel was the son of a very old friend
of his, who had died when William was quite
a boy. Eric and the Cubs disliked “Uncle
William,” for he never lost an opportunity
of snubbing them. They called him “the
Professor” behind his back. He had rather
long black hair, and a sullen, yellowish face.
He wore large, round spectacles, and stooped
badly. He had a nasty habit of peering
about him in a suspicious manner.</p>
<p>“Hullo, kiddies!” said old Sir David,
“what are you all doing in the dark?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been telling them about the secret
room, grandfather,” said Eric; “to-morrow
we are going to have a hunt for it.”</p>
<p>Sir David laughed. “All right,” he said,
“and a golden sovereign for the one who finds
it—that’s a bargain.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The Cubs were delighted.</p>
<p>But Uncle William was looking very cross.
“I shouldn’t have thought you would have
wanted to find the secret room, Eric,” he
said with a sneer. “You know it is haunted,
and brings trouble to whoever finds it.”</p>
<p>Old Sir David turned in surprise. “My
dear William,” he said, “you don’t mean to
say you believe in that old wives’ tale?”</p>
<p>William Mendel laughed an ugly laugh.
“Do you take me for a fool, father?” he said.
“I was only trying to frighten the children
from going to the left wing of the castle. You
know how exceedingly dangerous it is.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe it’s dangerous,” said Sir
David.</p>
<p>“Well, sir,” retorted William, “there will
be an accident one day if you let people walk
about in those rickety passages.”</p>
<p>Sir David shrugged his shoulders. It was
not the first argument he had had with his
adopted son about the left wing of the castle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>The Cubs were full of ideas about the secret
room, and how to find it and earn the sovereign,
as they went to bed that night.</p>
<h3>II
<br>AN ENEMY AT HAND</h3>
<p>Christmas had passed, one long succession of
delights, starting with a most generous Santa
Claus and ending with a New Year’s party.
Never had the four Cubs had such a Christmas!
But during all this time they had forgotten
the secret room. It was not until ten
days later that the intended search took place.
Tired and disappointed, the Cubs had come
down to tea, and it was then that Uncle William
had made his bright suggestion.</p>
<p>“There’s something more worth hunting
for in this neighbourhood than an old secret
room,” he said, “and you Cubs are just the
people to find it.”</p>
<p>“What’s that, sir?” asked the Cubs, eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>“Why, a <i>German spy</i>!” said Uncle William,
with a grin. “And if you catch him I will
give you each a golden sovereign—that’s a
bargain!” The Cubs were thrilled.</p>
<p>“We’ll go out and look for him first thing to-morrow
morning,” said Eric, cheerfully. But
his grandfather was looking very grave.</p>
<p>“It is really a very serious matter,” he said,
turning to William Mendel. “They say
there’s an enemy submarine in the Irish Sea.
Another liner was sunk this morning, only a
few miles from here. That’s the eighth ship
they’ve got near here in the last few weeks.
I was speaking to the police, this morning,
who say they suspect a base somewhere, at
which this boat gets its supply of petrol.
Otherwise it could not possibly remain so long
in enemy waters. But it must be an extraordinarily
clever arrangement, when one considers
how well the coast is guarded. I don’t
know what can have led them to suspect the
spy’s presence in this neighbourhood.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>“No,” said William Mendel, “That’s
what struck me. There would seem to be no
hiding-place for him. And as to a base for
providing a submarine with petrol about these
rocky shores—well, that’s out of the question.”</p>
<p>“Quite,” agreed Sir David, “quite.”</p>
<p>But the spy had given the Cubs an object
in life—they were hot on his tracks.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>Donald Ford, the Cub who had asked Eric
to tell them ghost stories on Christmas Eve,
had not given up hope of finding the secret
room. In fact, while the others were full of
the spy, he still thought most of the secret
room. He was not a very strong boy, and
often, when the others went out in the frosty
air, dashing over the bleak, stony hill through
a long afternoon, he would choose to stay in,
and sit by the log fire, dreaming, or reading
tales of the good old days of knights and
dragons and tournaments. It was on an
afternoon like this that he discovered the
old library.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Books lined the walls from floor to ceiling,
row upon row. Old brown leather bindings
they had, and gold lettering. They smelt
very ancient, and were very, very dusty.
But Donald loved to take them down, and
sit on the floor, looking at their quaint pictures.
And it was one day, sitting here in the library,
that he made a very wonderful discovery which
led to the strange adventure that befell him.</p>
<p>He had found an old book full of pictures
of knights and ladies and people going hawking,
dressed in curious, old-fashioned clothes.
On the fly-leaf of the book was written in a
big, childish hand, “Eric Stone, His Booke,
1640.”</p>
<p>Donald turned the old musty pages with
interest. So this book had belonged to a boy
just about three hundred years ago. As he
turned the pages a yellowish paper fluttered
from between them, and fell on to the floor.
Donald picked it up and examined it. It was
covered with writing in the same round hand
as there was on the fly-leaf. And this is
what he read:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>“I, Eric Stone, have found and discovered
a most strange thing. But for fear of the
ancient curse which brings dreadful mishap
I have not told any person. I will write it
here for him to read, who doth find this book.
I have found the Secret Room. It is on the
oak gallery, in the left wing of the Castle.
The manner of the hiding of the spring is this.
The oak panel is carved and ornamented with
roses. The twenty-seventh rose from the
end of the passage contains a hidden spring.
If the rose be pushed upwards it will slide up,
and also four inches of the panel. Below this
lies a picture, engraven upon steel, of a horse’s
head. If his right eye be pressed the spring
will be released, and a panel of the wall will
slide away. The room is empty.”</p>
<p>Donald’s heart beat fast as he read this
message, come down to him through the ages
from another boy. So he had the clue to the
secret! He determined to lose no time in
making the mysterious discovery, and ran
quickly up the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Pushing open a heavy baize door, he found
himself in the deserted left wing of the castle.
The long corridors were bare and uncarpeted.
Mounting a creaking staircase, he found himself
in the Oak Gallery. He felt terribly alone
and just a wee bit frightened; but, repeating
the Second Cub Law to himself, he ran to the
end of the passage. He was breathless with excitement.
“One—two—three—four—five—”
he counted the carved roses, “25—26—27—”
Here he paused and, following the instructions
on the paper, shoved the rose upwards. It
moved away easily, and, sure enough, revealed
a metal plate engraved with a horse’s
head! With a trembling finger Donald
pressed the great round eye of the horse.
Instantly a wide piece of the oak panel slipped
away, and, looking through the opening,
Donald saw before him a dim-lit room. He
was half afraid, but remembering he was a
Cub he braced himself and entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>He found himself in a long and very narrow
room. But it was not empty as it had been
when, three hundred years ago, another little
boy had stood in that same doorway and
looked in. From floor to ceiling the room
was piled high with petrol cans, small tanks,
and barrels. In one corner of the room a
small door stood open.</p>
<p>Thoughts whirled through Donald’s brain.
He had come on more than an old, dead secret,
here! Peering down through the little door
into the darkness he could just make out a
flight of steps leading down in the form of a
spiral staircase, in the thickness of the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h3>III
<br>“A PRIVATE CONVERSATION”</h3>
<p>That little, low door; the dusty steps leading
down into the unknown darkness; the strange,
musty smell—all this was too much for Donald.
If only Eric his Sixer were there, he
would not be afraid. But alone!—no, he
dared not venture down. Turning round, he
let himself out of the secret room, and carefully
closed the panel. Standing on the bare,
deserted landing, he looked about him. Was
he dreaming? Had he somehow walked into
a fairy tale? The oak-panelled wall showed
no signs, now, of the secret lying behind it.
Suddenly Donald felt a great longing to see
the other Cubs. Turning round, he ran as
fast as he could along the passages, and down
the stairs. Once through the green baize
door that separated the left wing from the
rest of the castle all was familiar and reassuring.
His footsteps no longer echoed as he
ran; in fact, you could not hear them as he
stepped on the thick, soft carpet. It was
warm, here, and he could hear the friendly
crackle of the great log fire down in the hall.
And then—welcome sound!—the front door
opened and the Cubs came in, talking cheerfully
of their game out on the hills. Tea in the
old dining-room was a noisy meal: but Donald
did not join in the noise. He was thinking of
the extraordinary thing he had discovered.</p>
<p>As soon as tea was over he called his Sixer
aside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>“I say,” he whispered, “I want to speak to
you privately—very privately.”</p>
<p>“Right-o!” said Eric, “come on—we’ll go
into the library, no one will hear us there.”</p>
<p>And so, squatting on the floor, among the
ancient books, Donald told his friend the story
of his strange discovery.</p>
<p>Eric’s eyes grew bright, and his face flushed
with excitement as he heard all Donald had
to tell. Here, at last, was a real adventure!
It had always been knights, or princes in fairy
tales, or boys who ran away and went to sea,
who had splendid things like that happen to
them. But at last the chance had come his
way!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>The next morning the two boys, white with
excitement, stole along the quiet passages of
the left wing, hand in hand. They both
carried candles. Donald was armed with a
stout stick, but his Sixer had insisted on bringing
his air-gun and an old dagger out of the
armoury. “There’ll be some dirty work if
we meet the spy!” said Eric (remembering
how he had heard his soldier cousin talk). “I
say, have you got the coil of rope all right?
We’ll set on him and take him prisoner. Then
he’ll be tried, and shot at the Tower of London,
I expect. And we shall be the chief witnesses.”
He breathed hard through his clenched teeth:
the fighting blood of the Stones was up.</p>
<p>At last they came to the gallery where the
walls were made of dark oak, carved with a
pattern of roses. Together the boys counted
the roses in a whisper, till they came to the
twenty-seventh. Then Donald worked the
hidden spring, and the two Cubs stepped
through the opening in the wall, into the
secret room. Closing the panel again from
the inside, they looked about them. The cans
and barrels were piled up to the very ceiling.
“It’s petrol, right enough,” said Eric, examining
the tins. “And a good many hundred
gallons, too. Not much ‘1640’ about <i>this</i>!
Oh, the <i>beasts</i>! Fancy using Stone Castle as
their base!” He gripped his dagger fiercely,
and looked about him. “Come on,” he whispered
a moment later, as, having lighted his
candle, he stepped through the low, dark archway,
and started to walk carefully down the
spiral staircase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>It was giddy work, this progress round and
round and down, in the flickering yellow light
of the candles. The boys’ shadows looked
like strange, black monsters on the walls.
At last they reached level ground, and a long,
dark passage opened before them. It smelt
damp and earthy; great drops of mildew
stood on the stone walls. With their hearts
thumping with excitement the Cubs stepped
forward.</p>
<p>They had walked what seemed to them
some three or four hundred yards, when Eric
suddenly called, “Stop—look out!” The passage
had ended abruptly in another spiral
staircase. Walking very carefully, the Cubs
began to descend. Down, down, down they
wound in the darkness, till they began to get
giddy. Then, once more, they were on the
level.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>“Another passage!” said Donald. “Oh,
Eric, I’m jolly glad I didn’t go without you!”</p>
<p>“Buck up,” said his Sixer, cheerfully.</p>
<p>“What if we are outnumbered?” suggested
Donald.</p>
<p>“Oh, we’ll ... we’ll ... we’ll <span class="sc">DO OUR
BEST</span>!” ended Eric, with a happy thought.</p>
<p>An icy blast was blowing up the passage,
and it felt very damp. There was a soft,
whispering sound ahead.</p>
<p>“It’s the sea!” said Eric. “Come on.”</p>
<p>They walked on for about ten yards, then
turned a sharp corner. “Daylight!” whispered
the boys in one breath, drawing back
into cover. Sure enough, the light of day was
streaming through a great jagged hole, far
above. There was no sound, save the murmur
of the sea, so the Cubs crept on, round the
bend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>They were in a large cave, dimly lighted
from the hole in the wall, above them. They
were standing on what seemed like a small
quay. Before them, black water moved softly,
making a gurgling, sucking sound, as it gushed
forth and drew back through a long, low
opening in the further wall of the cave.</p>
<p>“We come right down to the sea, below the
cliff,” said Eric. “This must be one of the
old smugglers’ caves. It’s full of water because
the shore, down here, is never quite out
of the water, you know.”</p>
<p>The boys stole forward to the edge of the
quay and peered down into the black water,
a foot or two below them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>“Look!” whispered Donald, suddenly, pointing
downward. Moored to an iron ring on the
quay was a curious looking object. “It’s
just like a submarine,” said Eric, “only much,
much too small. But I say,” he added, bending
over the boat, “it <i>is</i> a submarine—a tiny
one! Now, I see it all! They put heaps of
petrol in this, and just one or perhaps two
men to work it; and then, when the tide is up,
they dive, and get out of the cave by that
opening, ahead. The German submarine
comes up as near as it dares, and, at dead
of night, this little boat gives it as much
petrol as it wants. By Jove—we <i>have</i> found
something!”</p>
<h3>IV
<br>FOOTSTEPS</h3>
<p>As the two boys stood on the quay, looking
down into the dark waters, a faint sound
reached their ears. “Hush!” whispered Donald
quickly, “let’s blow out our candles and
take cover.”</p>
<p>“Don’t blow them out,” said Eric, “it
would leave a smell—pinch the wicks.”</p>
<p>In a moment the boys were in total darkness,
save for the faint glimmer of daylight from
the hole in the wall of the cave above their
heads. Moving very softly, they crept behind
a projecting rock, and squatted down, listening
breathlessly.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="./Danny Again_ a Project Gutenberg eBook_files/p117.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="758">
<p class="caption">“‘It’s just like a submarine,’ said Eric, ‘only much too
small. But I say,’ he added, bending over the boat, ‘it is a
submarine—a tiny one!’”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Soft footsteps were descending the spiral
staircase. It must be the spy! What sort
of man would he be? Would he carry a revolver?
What would he do to the Cubs if he
saw them? Perhaps he would throw them
into the black water. Or possibly he might
force them to go down into the little submarine
and take them out to the U-boat, and deport
them to Germany. Wild thoughts flew
through their minds, and they wished themselves
a thousand miles away. Meanwhile,
the footsteps were coming quickly along the
short passage. The Cubs held their breath,
their hearts beating wildly. A yellow beam
of light fell on the quay, and in another moment
a man stepped up to the water’s edge.
The Cubs could see him through a crack in
the rocks. As he turned round they saw his
face, and Eric caught his breath in a gasp of
surprise. It was William Mendel!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Opening the conning tower of the tiny submarine,
he stepped down into it. “Shall we
shut him in?” whispered Donald, under his
breath. Eric shook his head. William Mendel
had begun hammering, and making curious
noises, inside the boat. It was safe to whisper
without being heard. “If Uncle William is
the spy,” said Eric, “there’s no need to take
him prisoner, and risk getting taken ourselves.
If he doesn’t know he’s been discovered, he
will go on staying quite happily in the Castle.
All we have to do is to get back, tell grandfather
the whole story, and have him arrested.
All the same I would love to take the old
beast prisoner myself! But we shall be serving
our country better by having him taken
by the police, and made sure of. Think, if
he knocked us down and managed to escape!”</p>
<p>The traitor sounded very busy in the boat.
He had started the engine. “He’s overhauling
his engines,” whispered Eric. “We better
take this chance of getting out.” Very softly
the two Cubs crept from their hiding place,
back along the passage, and up the winding
stairs. With a sigh of relief they emerged
from the secret room, at last, and closed the
sliding panel behind them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<h3>V
<br>JENKINS</h3>
<p>“Now, what shall we do?” said Donald.</p>
<p>Eric was deep in thought. “I was going to
say—‘Let’s go to grandfather’s study’—but
it’s just struck me that Uncle William (ugh!
the beastly traitor!) is sure not to be working
alone. He must have a fellow spy helping
him. I am not sure that we ought not to
find out who it is before we speak to grandfather.
He’s sure to get the wind up frightfully,
and so will the police, and, of course,
the fellow spy will just bunk, with all the
plans.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Donald, “and—I believe I
know who the other spy is.”</p>
<p>“Who?” said Eric, turning on his companion.</p>
<p>“Jenkins,” said Donald.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>“By Jove, I believe you are right,” said
Eric. “Jenkins—Uncle William’s servant.
I always hated that sneaking Jenkins, with
his prying ways and long nose. All the servants
hate him, too. And now I come to think
of it, he was always having long, private talks
with Uncle William. Let’s get after him.”</p>
<p>The two boys crept downstairs, and through
a door in the hall into the servants’ quarters.
Whom should they run into but Jenkins, himself—Jenkins,
in a bowler hat, carrying a
little black bag.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” asked Eric.</p>
<p>“To London, Master Eric,” said Jenkins,
with his most innocent air.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“On business for Mr. Mendel. I mustn’t
stop, sir, or I shall miss my train.” He
pushed past the boys towards the door.</p>
<p>Eric was in despair—what should he do?
“Mr. Mendel’s business,” in London was sure
to be spy work. And if Jenkins went to London,
to-day, he might hear of his master’s
capture and never come back. Suddenly an
idea came to him. He stepped forwards between
Jenkins and the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>“You’re not go to London, Jenkins,” he
said, “my grandfather would not wish you to
go.”</p>
<p>Jenkins flushed an angry red, and was about
to push Eric aside, when old Briggs the butler
came along the passage.</p>
<p>“Briggs,” called Eric, “Jenkins says he’s
going to London. But whatever happens he
mustn’t go. My grandfather would be awfully
angry if he heard Jenkins was out of the
house. I can’t explain why, but you’ll know
soon. Will you take him into the pantry
and keep him there till grandfather sends for
him?”</p>
<p>Now Briggs hated Jenkins, and so he was
very glad to do anything to annoy him. Besides,
he could see that Eric was in earnest.
Taking Jenkins by the arm, he led him into the
pantry. The footman was in there, cleaning
silver, Eric was glad to see. Jenkins had gone
perfectly white, and his knees knocked together
as he walked. Suddenly Eric snatched
the little black bag from his hands. Jenkins
tried to keep hold of it, but Eric was too quick
for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>“Don’t leave him alone for a minute, will
you, Briggs?” said Eric.</p>
<p>“No, sir, I will not,” said Briggs. He
pushed Jenkins into a chair, where he sat
looking like a rat in a trap. He knew he was
found out, and that escape was impossible.</p>
<h3>VI
<br>HANDS UP, JENKINS</h3>
<p>“Now for grandfather’s study,” said Eric.</p>
<p>He led the way along a passage, and knocked
on the study door.</p>
<p>“Come in,” said Sir David.</p>
<p>The two boys entered, looking very serious.
They sat down on two chairs, opposite Sir
David, and first Donald told the story of the
finding of the secret room and then Eric went
on to describe how they had seen the spy. At
first old Sir David could not believe his ears:
but at last when he understood that it was
really his adopted son who was doing this
awful thing, it was terrible to see his grief.
Then Eric told of the meeting with Jenkins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>“Ring the bell,” said Sir David. Donald
did so. When the footman appeared, Sir
David told him to bring Jenkins. A moment
later Jenkins appeared, accompanied by Briggs
who showed him in, and then retired. Jenkins
was as white as a sheet. His fingers twitched,
as he walked across the room. Eric was watching
him narrowly. He saw him glance towards
the long French window, which stood open,
and then slip his right hand into his pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>“Sit down, Jenkins,” said Sir David. He
took his eyes off the man, and turned to see
if there was a chair at hand. Like a flash
Jenkins seized this opportunity, and whipped
a small revolver out of his pocket. But Eric
was too quick for him. Like a panther he
sprang upon him, dragging down his arm, and
wrenched the pistol from him. “Here, grandfather,
quick,” he said, thrusting the little
weapon into his hands. Sir David raised the
pistol and pointed it at Jenkins. “Hold your
hands above your head, and sit down quietly,”
he said. The man obeyed. “Now, Eric,
ring the bell.” Eric did so. Briggs appeared,
and looked somewhat surprised to see his
master pointing a revolver at Jenkins.
“Briggs,” said Sir David, “telephone at once
for the police. And when Mr. Mendel comes
in, ask him to come to my study at once.
Don’t let him think there is anything unusual,
but don’t let him out of your sight.”</p>
<p>“Very good, sir,” said Briggs, and retired.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the police arrived, and
handcuffed Jenkins. They had not been
there long before steps were heard approaching.
They were William Mendel’s steps.
“Well, father,” he said, as he came in,
“there’s good news to-day—another of those
beastly U-boats sunk—” Then he saw the
police, and Jenkins in handcuffs. His sallow
face went a death-like colour, and he seemed
to crumple up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>“Yes, William,” said Sir David, “there is
good news to-day. The men who give orders
to the U-boats have been caught. I hope we
shall now hear of no more tragedies in the
Irish Sea. Will you please hold out your
hands?” A constable had appeared, with a
pair of handcuffs.</p>
<p>Enough had been found in the little black
bag to convict Mendel, even without the
Cub’s story.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>A few days later Eric and Donald received
official thanks for having caught two most
dangerous spies, and having discovered the
base that was supplying two U-boats with
petrol. Donald Ford had got his sovereign
for finding the secret room, and the other
Cubs each got one because it was two of their
number that had found the German spies.
But it was not William Mendel who gave
them the sovereigns. He could not keep his
bargain, because he was a prisoner in the
Tower of London!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">In Mid-Air<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56658/56658-h/56658-h.htm#fn_2">[2]</a></span></h2>
<p>The summer holidays had come at last, and,
saying good-bye to hot, dirty, old London,
Sixer Billy Kemp had gone off to the Isle of
Wight with his father and mother and big
brother. He was sorry to leave the Pack, of
course. But before he went he promised his
Cubmaster that during the holidays he would
not let himself forget for one moment that
he was a Cub. He would always <i>do his best</i>
at whatever he was doing; he would find ways
of doing good turns for other people, and he
would not give in to himself, and be selfish
with his boats and his spade and water-wings;
but would let the children he played with on
the shore use them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>It was the first holiday he had had since
joining the Pack; and he found that one
enjoys oneself much more when one has these
cubby ideas. All the little boys and girls he
played with thought no end of him, because,
for one thing, he was so kind, and for another,
he never seemed afraid of anything. You see,
he had only to say: “A Cub does not give in
to himself,” and it became almost easy to do
the hard thing. For instance, when the sea
was very rough and the waves knocked you
down, it was very frightening to go in, and
most of the children gave up bathing that
day. But Billy faced the waves, and his big
brother Jim was proud of him. Then, on
very cold days Billy went in, as usual. And
just because he never gave in to himself,
he managed to learn to swim and float, those
holidays. When one of the men dared him
to jump off the diving-board, right out in the
deep water, he set his teeth and did it. And,
as to walking on the stones with bare feet—you
would have thought he liked it! He
even used to carry his very small friends across,
because the stones hurt their feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>This story is about a wonderful adventure
which befell Billy through his habit of doing
things that other boys were afraid of.</p>
<p>Billy’s brother, Jim, a boy of seventeen, was
mad on flying. He hoped some day to be an
airman. His great hobby was making kites,
and he spent all those holidays making the
most wonderful great kite any one had ever
seen. It was made of dark brown canvas and
bamboo rods. It was eighteen feet long, and
he had named it the <i>Eagle</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>When, at last, it was ready, Jim set out
with Billy and a dozen of his friends, to let
her up for her first flight. Jim carried the
precious roll of brown stuff. Billy shouldered
the supple spars that fitted into pockets,
and stretched the canvas taut. Another boy
carried the great coil of strong cord, and everyone
talked at the same time of what the <i>Eagle</i>
would do on her first flight. Going along the
rough, stony path that led from the village of
Sea View towards Ryde, they were soon at a
big, grassy stretch of low-lying land near the
sea. A stiff gale was blowing from the southeast—it
was a perfect day.</p>
<p>Spreading out the <i>Eagle</i> on the grass, Jim
fitted in the spars, fastened the big hooks to
eyelets, and made fast the cord. At last all
was ready.</p>
<p>“She’ll take some holding!” he said, as he
lifted the kite up, and felt the quiver and
flutter of the great wings, as the wind touched
them. So the boys formed up in a long line,
and the rope was passed along from one to
the other. Then Jim lifted the <i>Eagle</i>, and
held her up as high as he could. For a moment
she trembled, and then, a puff of wind
catching her, she leapt up, out of his hold,
and began to rise in swift swoops.</p>
<p>“Pay out the rope,” shouted Jim.</p>
<p>The boys let it run through their hands and
Jim took his place at the end of the line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>“I say, isn’t she ripping?” he cried. “I
wonder what she’s pulling? She’d lift a good
weight, I should say.” Suddenly an idea
struck him. “I believe she’d take a passenger!”
he said. “How glorious it would be to
go soaring up with her! But I should be too
heavy. She could easily lift one of you kids!”</p>
<p>The boys looked up at the kite, far, far
above their heads in the blue sky. It made
them feel dizzy to think of being up there.
Then, to Jim’s surprise, Billy spoke.</p>
<p>“I’ll go up,” he said.</p>
<p>Of course Jim knew that he had no business
to let his small brother do anything so dangerous.
But he did long to show that the kite
he had made, himself, was as good as an
aeroplane.</p>
<p>“<i>Will</i> you, kid?” he said. “It would be
quite safe. I wouldn’t let you go up very
far. You would just have to hook your arm
over the rope, and hang on tight.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t he sit on the kite?” asked one of
the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>“No,” said Jim. “It would spoil her
balance. We must haul her down as low as
we can, and then he can go up on the rope.”</p>
<p>So they hauled and hauled, and little by
little the <i>Eagle</i> came down.</p>
<p>Billy’s heart beat fast, but he was a Cub
and would not show that he was afraid.</p>
<p>“Now,” said Jim, “put your arm over—that’s
it! I won’t let you go more than about
forty feet up. Now, let go a bit, boys.”</p>
<p>Suddenly Billy felt himself being lifted off
the ground and carried swiftly up into the
clear, sunny air. It was glorious—nearly as
good as being an airman! He could feel the
great kite throbbing and straining above him.
He glanced downwards; the earth seemed far
below. There were all the boys hanging on
to the rope in a long line.</p>
<p>Suddenly a shout reached him. Looking
down he saw a sight that sent a thrill of horror
through him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Charging across the grass, head down, tail
up, was a huge red bull! Its furious roar made
his blood run cold. It was making straight
for the boys. Gazing with fascinated horror,
Billy saw the little chaps at the end of the
line let go and start running hard for the road.</p>
<p>He could see his brother hanging on manfully
with a few of the elder boys. Surely
they could never hold the kite, alone! It was
dragging them along. The bull was making
straight for them. It was on them! Billy felt
the jerk of the cord as the boys jumped aside
to let it crash on, past them. But in their
efforts to avoid the horns of the maddened
beast the rope was torn from their hands.
Billy felt the kite shudder as the pressure on
the cord was relaxed, and then swoop upwards
in a mad rush, carrying him with it, high, high
into the cold air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>What should he do? He could only hang
on, hang on. He set his teeth. Glancing
down, he saw that he was already rushing
out over the Solent. He could see little white
sailing boats on the blue, blue sea. Where
would he be carried to? When would he
come down? Already he began to feel faint
and dizzy. His arm was aching with the
strain. He was getting cold and numb.</p>
<p>“Before long I shall drop off,” he thought
vaguely.</p>
<p>Then he roused himself. He would not
give in. He would have a try, at least, to
bring the kite down. He remembered that
Jim had said if any one was up with the kite
itself, it would spoil her balance. He would
try to get up to her.</p>

<p>He had often climbed a rope before. But
this swaying cord, high in mid-air, was no
easy matter. Gripping tight with his hands,
and holding it between his legs and feet, he
mounted slowly, slowly. At last he was up
and could touch the canvas. He felt the
kite dip and quiver. But she kept to her
course, falling a little and swaying giddily.
What could he do? It was impossible to
climb up that smooth, tight canvas. Then
he had an idea. Clinging on with one hand
and his legs, he felt in his pocket for his big
jack-knife. This he opened with his teeth,
and had soon cut a great ragged hole in the
canvas. Thrusting his arm into this first,
he drew himself up until he was sitting on
the spar. At once the great kite swerved,
heeled over, trembled, and began to come
down.</p>
<p>But the wind was very strong, and Billy
was very light. The <i>Eagle</i> still kept on her
way, though wobbling very much now and
then, as if she meant to do a “spinning nose-dive”
into the sea. Looking down, Billy
could see the great waves tossing and surging
below. Would he ever reach the other side?
He clung for dear life to the spar of the kite.
He was so cold that he wouldn’t be able to
hold on much longer. So, taking off his belt,
he slipped it under the spar, and then lying
flat on his front, fastened it round him again.</p>
<p>Looking down over the edge, he saw that
he was across the Solent and beginning to
skim over the mainland. He was flying over
trees and fields, for he had left Portsmouth
away on his right. When and where would
he come down?</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Suddenly the kite turned over, and Billy
would have been thrown out, had he not been
strapped to the spar. He clung on like grim
death, trying to imagine he was an airman,
looping the loop. Then the <i>Eagle</i> seemed to
lose her balance altogether, and Billy felt
himself falling towards the ground, the kite
merely acting as a parachute.</p>
<p>What happened he never knew, for he
opened his eyes to find himself lying on the
ground with a crowd round him.</p>
<p>“He’s all right,” said a cheery voice.</p>
<p>He was surrounded by wounded soldiers—he
recognized them by their blue suits and
red ties.</p>
<p>“Where am I?” he asked, in a very faint
little voice.</p>
<p>“‘After looping the loop three times the
gallant airman made his descent in the grounds
of Netley Hospital,’” said one of the Tommies
as if he were quoting from a newspaper!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The next thing Billy knew was that a doctor
in a white coat, with khaki puttees showing
from under it, had picked him up in his arms
and was carrying him across the grass between
rows and rows of huts painted white and grey.</p>
<p>Before long he was lying on a bed with a
Red Cross nurse bending over him.</p>
<p>“You’ll soon be all right, sonny,” she said
in a comforting voice. “Now drink this.
You <i>have</i> had a fly! But the doctor says
there’s no harm done—only a few bruises.
I expect you feel a bit shaky.”</p>
<p>He stayed in the hut that night, and had a
splendid time. Every nurse and patient in
the hospital wanted to have a look at him and
hear about his wonderful flight. The next
day his father came over and took him home.</p>
<p>“Good-bye! Good-bye!” he said, waving
his hand to the Tommies who came to the
gate to see him off.</p>
<p>“So long!” they cried. “Fly over and
see us again, one day, kid!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Dicky’s Chance</span></h2>
<p>The excitement had been great the night the
Cubmaster of the Erlington Pack had told
his Cubs about the new badges. They had
cheered themselves hoarse. Swimming was,
of course, the badge they wanted most, but,
as the Cubmaster pointed out, though it
would be a ripping badge to get, there was not
a swimming-bath or river anywhere handy,
and the sea was forty miles away!</p>
<p>Athletes and Artists they had also voted for,
but the Old Wolf reminded them that the first
use of a Wolf Cub is not to be able to jump
very high or draw very well, but to <i>serve other
people</i>, and he suggested that the first badge to
be worked for should be the “House Orderly.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>So on the following Friday night the twelve
two-star Cubs had met together to learn home
craft. The first lesson had been nearly all
taken up with learning the very best way to
light a fire. And before they went home the
Old Wolf had called them round him in an
eager circle. “Cubs,” he had said, “before
we meet next week I want each of you to have
practised ‘helping Mother,’ and to have lit
the fire at least once for her. Now I want you
all to think hard for three minutes by my
watch, and then each to tell me a good way
in which you could help mother.”</p>
<p>The Cubs thought hard with knitted
brows. And when the three minutes was up
each told of a good way in which he could help.
One could weed the front garden; another
could turn the mangle; one was going to
spring-clean the whole house, although it <i>was</i>
winter! One was going to “bathe baby”—which
made everyone laugh. Only one Cub,
Dicky Dean, failed to think of a way to help
his mother. “Why, mother doesn’t do anything
but sit on the drawing-room sofa and
read!” thought Dicky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>“Come, Dicky, how can you help?” said
the Cubmaster. There was a long pause.
Then someone giggled. “<i>His</i> mother don’t
want no helping, sir,” said a scornful voice;
“she’s got paid servants!”</p>
<p>“Silence, there!” said the Old Wolf sternly.
Then turning to Dicky, “Cheer up, old chap,”
he said; “you’ll find a way if you try.” And
Dicky went home thinking hard.</p>
<p>All the Cubs’ mothers had been “awfully
bucked,” as one of the Cubs said, when their
sons took to cleaning everything and lighting
fires and making their beds themselves. But
poor Dicky never seemed able to please <i>his</i>
mother.</p>
<p>There was the time when he was standing
on the step-ladder in the street, cleaning the
windows, and a very elegant lady, Mrs. Jones,
had called and been much shocked, so that
mother was angry and had punished Dicky,
as though he were doing something wrong!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>There was the time Cook was so furious
because she found him about to put a match
to the kitchen fire, which he had laid himself
at 6 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> as a surprise for her. She had said
he was a naughty little boy; he was playing
in her kitchen and trying to set the house
afire! And then the time mother was so
cross because he had blacking on his hands
and a smudge on his nose. And when he had
explained that he had been making his boots
lovely and black and shiny, like coal—and
Cook’s as well—she had been still more angry,
and said he must not be so mischievous, and
meddle with what did not concern him. Altogether,
everything was very sad. He went to
bed one night feeling especially down in the
dumps, for his mother had again scolded him.</p>
<p>The next morning’s post brought Mrs.
Dean some very bad news. The bank in
which she had nearly all her money had closed
its doors; it was paying nothing at all, and
she was left with a very little sum of money
and the house which her husband had built a
few years before he died. Her friend, Mrs.
Jones, came to condole with her.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic6">

<p class="caption">“There was the time he was standing on a step-ladder in the

had called and been much shocked”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>When she had heard the whole sad story,
she looked very serious.</p>
<p>“And you say you are going to dismiss both
your servants? My dear Mrs. Dean, what
<i>will</i> you do? Who will do the work for you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, <i>I</i> don’t know,” sobbed Mrs. Dean.
“I shall have to myself, I suppose. It’s hard,
very hard. And it’s not as if I had a daughter.
I’ve only Dicky—a great, helpless boy. Why,
it’s all we can do to keep him out of mischief.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Dean was very unhappy.</p>
<p>A few days later the maids went away.
Dicky saw them off, watched their cab rattle
away, and then went into the garden to think
out a great plan. His chance had come at
last!</p>
<p>That night he bumped his head five times
on the pillow.</p>
<p>“I—will—wake—up—at—five,” he said,
with each bump. And then he dropped off
to sleep with a very happy heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>In the grey dawn Dicky got up. He stole
downstairs on tiptoe. He lit the kitchen fire.
He swept the rooms. He whitened the front-doorstep.
He blacked his mother’s shoes.
He laid the table for breakfast. He put on
the kettle. He rummaged in the larder and
discovered some bacon and two eggs; and
he did it all in a whisper.</p>
<p>At 7.30, just as he had run up to his room for
a wash, he heard his mother calling.</p>
<p>“Yes, mother,” he answered from his room.</p>
<p>“Dicky,” she said, “get up at once, and
come to my room in a quarter of an hour, to
look after baby while I get breakfast ready.”</p>
<p>Dicky laughed to himself. “Yes, mother,”
he called.</p>
<p>On tiptoe he ran downstairs again. He
made toast; he fried the eggs and bacon (as
he had been taught), and made the tea, and
put everything on the dining-room table.
Then he went upstairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>“Stay with baby, dear,” said Mrs. Dean
wearily, “while I go and get breakfast ready.
Oh, how I miss the maids! I’m so tired;
baby’s been crying for nurse most of the
night. There will be nothing but work all day
to get the house straight.” She sighed, and
went downstairs.</p>
<p>With beating heart, Dicky listened. He
heard her go slowly down the stairs. Then
he heard her hurrying from the kitchen into
the other rooms. Then silence.</p>
<p>He could bear the suspense no longer. He
ran softly to the bottom of the staircase.
Outside the dining-room door he paused.
There was a sound like a sob. Was she angry
at what he had done?</p>
<p>“Mother,” he said, in a shaky little voice,
as he pushed the door open.</p>
<p>She was waiting for him with her arms outstretched.
He threw himself into them.</p>
<p>“Dicky,” she said, “my dear little Dicky,
did you do all this? The fire alight, breakfast
cooked, and everything?”</p>
<p>“Yes, mother,” he panted, “and the doorstep
looks lovely! Oh, I’m so happy, mother.
I always wanted to help, and I often tried.
But you were never pleased. Now, I shall
always do all the work all the time, and you
will always be pleased, won’t you?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>“Always, always,” she said. “But we will
work together—and, and play together when
the work is done, and, though we are very
poor now, we shall be very happy!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Dicky. “We <i>shall</i> be happy
and when baby’s old enough we’ll teach him
to help, too, won’t we?”</p>
<p>And that is how Dicky got his chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">The Bishop’s Story</span></h2>
<p>A Bishop was coming to see the Pack—a very,
very agèd Bishop, very holy and very wise.
The Cubs felt rather nervous. But, of course,
it was a great honour. They scrubbed out
their headquarters, and decorated it with
evergreens. And they arranged a Council
Rock for the Bishop to sit on—a big wooden
armchair.</p>
<p>“When you have given the Bishop a Grand
Howl,” said the Cubmaster, “he will sit on
the Council Rock and speak a few words to
you.”</p>
<p>“Will it be a <i>sermon</i>?” asked the Cubs,
pulling long faces. They didn’t like sermons,
you see.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the Cubmaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>When the Bishop arrived he had such merry,
little twinkling eyes and such a kind smile
that the Cubs were not a bit afraid of him.
He talked in such a jolly way that they quite
forgot how very respectful they ought to be;
and they crowded round him and all told him
things at the same time. And when it came
to the Grand Howl, they shouted louder than
they had ever shouted before, because they
thought the greater and older and holier the
Old Wolf on the Council Rock was, the louder
they ought to shout!</p>
<p>Then the Bishop sat down.</p>
<p>“Now, I suppose, I’m expected to preach
you a sermon?” he said. “But I know you
all hate sermons.”</p>
<p>The boys looked abashed, and wondered
how he had read their thoughts.</p>
<p>“Well,” said the Bishop, “it shall only be
a very short sermon. But first I’ll tell you a
story. I know you all love stories.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!” said the Cubs all together, their
eyes sparkling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>“Then all squat down, like the young wolves
in the jungle, and prick up your ears, and
listen to this old, old Wolf. It is a story
someone told to me when I was a little boy.”</p>
<h3>THE WHITE HORSE</h3>
<p>“Many hundreds of years ago,” said the
Bishop, “there lived a great King, very wise
and splendid, who was loved by all his people.
To please them he gave a great feast to celebrate
his birthday. All the people put on their
holiday clothes and came to the Palace garden,
where they feasted and danced, wrestled,
and took part in many sports. When the
sun began to slope down towards the west,
the trumpets blared forth, calling the people
to come together in the wide space before the
Palace, where the King would speak to his
subjects, and where they would hail him with
cheers and do him honour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>“So a great crowd collected, and the King,
in scarlet and ermine and gold, stepped forth
upon the dais that had been decked with
flowers and cloth of gold for his honour. And
it was at this moment that a tramp of feet
was heard, a champing of bits, the noise of
people arriving from a journey. All heads
were turned to see who was coming. Then
two heralds, clad in green and gold, stepped
forward and made low obeisance and delivered
their message. They had come from a neighbouring
Prince to wish the King all good fortune
upon his birthday, and to bring him a
gift. The gift, they said, was a white horse.
It was the most beautiful horse that had ever
been bred in the Prince’s country—perfect in
every point.</p>
<p>“‘Bring it forth,’ cried the King, very
pleased with the gift, for he loved horses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>“The heralds bowed, withdrew, and all the
people waited expectantly. The beat of hoofs
sounded on the white marble pavement. A
murmur of admiration broke from the waiting
crowd like the roar of the sea. A beautiful
white horse was being led forward, decked
with green satin accoutrements and hangings,
studded with jewels that sparkled in the sun.
A golden bit was in his mouth, and a jewelled
bridle about his stately head. His gilded
hoofs dazzled the eyes of all beholders as he
lifted his feet, stepping proudly forward to his
royal master.</p>
<p>“But no sooner had he stepped on to the
marble pavement than he stopped, trembling
and rolling his eyes in terror. The groom
coaxed him, and tried to lead him on, but
every few yards he stopped, prancing restively,
swerving away, drawing back. The people
ceased to applaud; they even stilled their
whispers of admiration, and held their breath.
At last the beautiful animal reached the King’s
throne. The King stood up, his eyes shining
with pleasure at the present. He would have
descended to the animal’s side, but the horse
had begun to curvet and prance and shy away,
as if from some unseen terror. In vain the
groom patted his neck and spoke soothing
words into his ear. The horse’s eyes were
starting from his head as if he saw something
beside him which filled him with fear. He
was beginning to rear, and the Court looked
on in dismay. Had the Prince sent a wild,
unbroken horse as a gift to their King?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>“Then something strange happened. A
little stable boy, who had come to the feast,
stepped forward out of the crowd. Bowing
low before the King, he said that he knew why
the horse was afraid and would not stand
before his Majesty.</p>
<p>“The King, who was always willing to hear
the opinion of his very lowest vassal if it was
worth hearing, gave orders that the royal
groom should give the white horse into the
charge of the little stable boy. Bowing low,
the groom withdrew, and the boy took the
golden reins into his hands. Gradually he
led the horse, still prancing wildly, away past
the throne. Then some twenty yards on he
stopped, turned the horse round, and began
leading him back. It was as if a miracle had
been worked. The horse was perfectly quiet,
and as he was led once more before the royal
throne he stood still and calm.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic7">
<img src="./Danny Again_ a Project Gutenberg eBook_files/p157.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="706">
<p class="caption">“Gradually he led the horse, still prancing wildly, away past
the throne”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>“‘Well done, little stable boy!’ cried the
King, stepping from his golden dais and patting
the beautiful animal’s neck. ‘But tell
me, little friend, why was he afraid?’</p>
<p>“‘Sire,’ said the boy, bending his knee,
‘’twas his own black shadow on the marble
floor he feared. I did but turn his face to
the sun, and the shadow is behind him, where
he sees it not.’</p>
<p>“How do you boys go through your day?”
asked the old Bishop, looking at each one with
his keen, kind eyes, that twinkled like little
blue jewels in his wrinkled face. “Do you
go through the day filled with discontent?—trying
first to avoid doing this disagreeable
thing, and then that one? Afraid of a little
trouble, a little pain, a little hardship? Do
you pull away every time your conscience
says, ‘Tommy, come this way: do that’?
Do you jump about and shy, and try and run
away, like the white horse, when your mother
has told you to do something or other? And
are you always nervous—afraid of being
‘found out’? And if you are alone in the
dark do you get ‘creeps,’ and think there are
bogeys coming after you?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Some of the Cubs looked down on the
ground, and answered nothing. They wondered
how the Bishop knew all about them,
when he was a stranger.</p>
<p>“Do you know how I know some boys are
like that?” he said at length. “You see I
have not always been a Bishop, and I have
not always been very, very old! Once I was
a very naughty small boy, and I can still
remember exactly how it felt. I used to do
all those things I mentioned to you just
now. In fact, I behaved like the white horse;
because, you see, I was looking at my shadow—that
is, at my ugly little black self, and all
<i>I</i> wanted. I couldn’t help seeing myself all
the time, and I was always discontented.
Why was it the horse saw his shadow?”</p>
<p>“’Cos he’d got his back to the sun,” said
one of the Cubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>“Yes,” said the Bishop, “and so had I—that’s
why I couldn’t help always seeing myself.
And then, one day, I turned round
and faced the sun; that is, I turned and fixed
my eyes on <i>God</i>, the great, shining Sun of our
life—and my own shadow fell behind me, and
I forgot all about what <i>I</i> felt, and <i>I</i> wanted.
And I became so happy! And I wasn’t afraid
of being ‘found out’ any more. And I didn’t
get creeps in the dark. And it became easy
to do all the hard things, because I was facing
God and doing them for Him.”</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>“Wish the Bishop would come every week,”
said the Cubs, when he had gone, “and we
wouldn’t mind if he preached a sermon every
time!”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
